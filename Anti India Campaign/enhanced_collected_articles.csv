'land of the Khalsa') in the Punjab region.[2] The proposed boundaries of Khalistan vary between different groups; some suggest the entirety of the Sikh-majority Indian state of Punjab, while larger claims include Pakistani Punjab and other parts of North India such as Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.[3] The call for a separate Sikh state began during the 1930s, when British rule in India was nearing its end.[4] In 1940, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in a pamphlet titled ""Khalistan"".[5][6] In the 1940s, a demand for a Sikh country called 'Sikhistan' arose.[7] With financial and political support from the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab ‚Äì which has a Sikh-majority population ‚Äì continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, and reaching its zenith in the late 1980s. The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter affirmed his support for the Khalistan movement in retaliation for the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, which resulted in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan.[8] The insurgency in Punjab started in the early 1980s after 1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clash.[9][10] Several Pro-Khalistan groups were involved in the armed insurgency, including Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Commando Force, among others.[11] In 1986, Khalistan Commando Force took responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Vaidya, in retaliation for 1984's Operation Blue Star.[12][13] By the mid-1990s, the insurgency petered out, with the last major incident being the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh, who was killed in a bomb blast by a member of ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T19:04:49.334551,"[""Hindu nationalism"", ""kashmir liberation"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.008596234849136079

A moment of silence in the parliament reflects an unequivocal consensus among representatives of all the political parties in the House of Commons.2 Such non-partisan consensus vis-√†-vis Khalistani separatists has not been uncommon in Canada. Since the early 1980s, the Canadian political landscape, irrespective of the political parties in power, has been permissive, if not sympathetic, to the Khalistan movement. The driving forces behind such political consensus have ranged from Cold War dynamics before 1990s to domestic politics at present. For years, successive Canadian governments, regardless of the political parties in power, have demonstrated a tendency to overlook Indian security concerns and have adopted a lenient approach towards Khalistan-related activities. While doing so, the Canadian government‚Äôs attitude has been shaped by three overarching factors‚ÄîCold War dynamics; political stance on freedom of expression; and considerations of vote bank politics. Cold War Era Dynamics During the Cold War, in alignment with other Western countries, Canada engaged with India through various bilateral avenues such as project financing, food aid and technical assistance. This was exemplified by the establishment of the CIRUS nuclear reactor at the Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment in 1954. However, bilateral relations between the two nations experienced a downturn following India‚Äôs peaceful nuclear explosion in 1974 with fissile materials sourced from the aforementioned reactor.

India has denied the allegations from Canada, describing them as ""absurd"". After the US allegations emerged, India said it had formed a high-level inquiry committee to address them.

The vast majority live in India, where they make up around 2% of the country's 1.4bn people.

Since the 1980s, radical separatists have spearheaded a bloody campaign to carve out an independent, theocratic Sikh state in India known as Khalistan (Land of the Pure). Despite being dormant in India, the Khalistan movement has recently surged vigorously in the Western diaspora. Khalistani extremists have actively used American, Canadian, and British soil for their cause and grown increasingly violent. In the past year alone, Khalistanis attacked both the Consulate General of India in San Francisco and India High Commission in London and vandalized temples in New York City, in the Toronto area Australia, and California. The FBI, DEA, and United States Customs Service (USCS) have conducted numerous investigations into the activities of pro-Khalistan extremists in the US. Download our Khalistan brief for law enforcement here LISTEN: THAT'S SO HINDU History of the Khalistani Movement‚Äôs Aims and Methods The roots of Khalistan lie in the British colonial policies of the late 1800s and early 1900s that sought to divide Sikhs and Hindus. Sikhs were recruited into the British army in large numbers to use against Hindu rulers that rebelled against the British Raj. Subsequently, after Indian independence in 1947, tensions between the state of Punjab and the central Indian government surfaced, leading to grievances amongst many Sikhs against the Indian government. Punjab, for instance, was trifurcated into the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh in 1966, along linguistic lines (Punjab as a Punjabi speaking state, and Haryana and Himachal Pradesh as Hindi speaking states), which created resentment amongst many Sikhs that the historic contours of Punjab were being further divided after it has already been divided between India and Pakistan in 1947. Many Sikhs in Punjab also resented sharing the joint capital of Chandigarh with Haryana, and viewed water sharing agreements with Haryana ",https://www.hinduamerican.org/khalistan/,www.hinduamerican.org,2025-08-28T19:05:04.484489,"[""anti-India"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.hinduamerican.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.05234231876472127

Chris Helgren/Reuters CNN ‚Äî In the early hours of June 23, 1985, a bomb planted in the cargo hold of Air India flight 182 traveling from Montreal to New Delhi exploded off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people on board. The people arrested and charged for the bomb attack were Indian-born Sikh Canadians, alleged by prosecutors to be radical separatists seeking revenge for the Indian army‚Äôs deadly storming of the Golden Temple in Punjab state the previous year. Only one was convicted; two were acquitted in 2005, and in 2016, Canada released the only person ever found guilty of the bombing. Nearly four decades on, that terrorist attack ‚Äì which remains the worst in Canada‚Äôs history ‚Äì and the wider history of overseas Sikh separatism has suddenly been thrust back into the international spotlight in the wake of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‚Äôs allegations the Indian state may have been involved in the June killing on Canadian soil of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. New Delhi had previously designated Nijjar, an Indian-born Canadian national, as a terrorist, and accused him of being behind a banned militant group that sought to ‚Äúradicalize the Sikh community across the world‚Äù in support of Khalistan ‚Äì a separate Sikh homeland that would include parts of India. Nijjar‚Äôs supporters rejected the terrorist label, arguing it was used to discredit the Sikh leader, who was known for his Khalistan advocacy and speaking out against alleged human rights abuses by India‚Äôs government. Trudeau‚Äôs assassination claim has inflamed relations with New Delhi, which has fiercely denied the allegation and taken a series of diplomatic measures to make clear its displeasure with Canada.

Canada is investigating possible links between the Indian government and the assassination of Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. The Canadian government also said that it has expelled a top Indian diplomat as a consequence. What is the Khalistan movement? About The Khalistan movement is a fight for a separate, sovereign Sikh state in present day Punjab (both India and Pakistan). The movement was crushed in India following Operation Blue Star (1984) and Operation Black Thunder (1986 and 1988). Operation Blue Star began on June 1, 1984 to flush out militants from the Golden Temple and neutralise Bhindranwale. The Khalistan movement is banned in India, where officials see it and its affiliated groups as a national security threat. But the movement still has some support in north India, as well as beyond, in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom which are home to a sizable Sikh diaspora. Khalistan and Canada As per the 2021 Canadian census, Sikhs account for 2.1 per cent of Canada‚Äôs population, and are the country‚Äôs fastest growing religious group.

(AP Photo) by Yousaf Junaid Aug 05, 2025 12:05 am The U.N.-administered plebiscite in Kashmir is vital for sustainable peace in South Asia As the calendar marks Aug. 5, we solemnly observe ""Youm-e Istehsal-e-Kashmir"" (the Day of Exploitation of Kashmir), the day when the Indian government, breaching fundamental international legal norms and rules, illegally and unilaterally revoked articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution. These articles conferred autonomous status upon Kashmir, along with special rights and privileges for the Kashmiris. Though these Indian constitutional guarantees are in no way a substitute for the United Nations-sponsored plebiscite, their revocation was a step toward the Indian colonization drive of Jammu and Kashmir and steps to alter the ground realities in gross violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions. A ploy that India has learnt from Israel‚Äôs actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. These Indian actions are aimed at further enhancing their ongoing repression and systemic marginalization of the Kashmiri people. The observance of Aug. 5 serves as a stark reminder of the enduring struggle for self-determination and justice, and calls upon the international community to fulfill the promise made to the Kashmiri people by the U.N. Security Council (UNSC), i.e, the right to self-determination. Indian occupation of Kashmir The genesis of the Kashmir issue dates back to the partition of British India in 1947, which was based on the principle that regions with Muslim majorities would be part of Pakistan, while those with Hindu majorities would join India.

2025-08-28T19:08:08.291464,Kashmir: The Clash of Identities | Beyond Intractability,"By Neha Navlakha March, 2009 Summary Kashmir is a divided state. Two of its regions are controlled by Pakistan and three regions are controlled by India. Both countries, however, lay claim to the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmiri people themselves have long been striving for autonomy and ultimately independence. At its core therefore, this is a conflict that is both intrastate and interstate in its nature. The insurgency began in 1988 initiated by young nationalists from Jammu Kashmir Liberation Force (JKLF) - who crossed over to Pakistan to get trained and armed - supported by Kashmiris who took to the streets to call for a plebiscite after years of being forced to abide by the wishes and rules imposed by the central government. India labeled the insurgency a proxy war by Pakistan and responded with force.[1] In response to the insurgency, India introduced direct rule in 1990. Security forces moved in, the Kashmiri civil administration - education, services, courts, etc. - collapsed, leading to further suffering, discontent and increased despair in the valley. The desperate situation in Kashmir influenced more young Kashmiris to join the militants, as they could see no nonviolent avenue to initiate change. The militant groups thereby grew in size and also turned more Islamist. This was particularly evident after the cease-fire in 1994, as groups such as Lashkar-e-Toiba joined, bringing hardened fighters from Afghanistan, which today form the core of the militants.[2] After three wars - in 1947, 1965 and 1971 - a serious armed conflict in 1999 in Kargil and a UN resolution promising plebiscite, the conflict is still far from over. Despite numerous attempts at finding a solution, parties to the conflict have repeatedly failed at finding an alternative that would satisfy everyone involved.[3] Ultimately, the Kashmir conflict embodies a complex amalgamation of religious, nationalist and political factors which are deeply rooted in history.

The speakers included Dr. Hafsa Kanjwal and the chair ‚Äì Francis Cody. Dr. Kanjwal is an Associate Professor of South Asian History at Lafayette College in Eaton, Pennsylvania.

Esmat Elhalaby is an affiliate of the Centre for South Asian Studies at the Asian Institute and Assistant Professor of Transnational History at the Department of Historical and Cultural Studies. He works principally on the intellectual history of West and South Asia. Before a summary and discussion of the book began, Kanjwal led a brief abstract on her deliberation while writing it. She explored how the text was based on years of research and dialogue with Kashmiri residents on the conditions of Indian occupation between the 1950s and 1980s. Her motivation behind publishing the book was to open dialogue in academia and politics on rethinking colonization by colonized people, understand the intricate sociopolitical dynamics in the Global South, and deliberate on nation-states‚Äô impacts overarchingly. To set the stage for her main arguments, Kanjwal began the discussion with a history lesson on the beginnings of the Indian occupation of Kashmir. She explained how the United Nations ordained a plebiscite to resolve the issue following the partition. However, forces from both Pakistan and India were unrelenting in removing their troops from the occupied territories, and a plebiscite has not occurred since. To strengthen its influence in Kashmir, the Indian government staged a coup to bring Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed to power.

Nehru, speaking of the character of Kashmiris, writes: ‚ÄúIt must be remembered that the people of the Kashmir Valley and round about, though highly gifted in many ways‚Äîin intelligence, in artisanship, etc.‚Äîare not what are called a virile people.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúThey are soft and addicted to easy living. . . .

The practice of destroying homes has been especially common in the hinterlands. However, it is only in the recent years that news reports have covered this widespread punitive action. In picture, a Kashmiri woman stands on the rubble of her house, destroyed in police action during a gunfight with militants. File photo by ABID BHAT Strange pictures emerged last month in Srinagar, India-administered Kashmir. Police personnel were seen distributing roses amongst doctors and paramedics. This was apparently a damage-control exercise after the department came under fire for harassing people, including the medical staff fighting at the frontlines of the pandemic response, during the Covid-19 lockdown announced by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The images presented a sharp contrast of guns held tightly in one hand and roses in the other, much like India‚Äôs claims of development and empowerment in Kashmir amidst continued violence. Barely days after the guns-and-roses act, unsurprisingly, another doctor was ruthlessly beaten. The images were reminiscent of the roses placed at checkpoints manned by Israeli forces in occupied Palestine.

When understood in comparison with other cases of forced demographic changes worldwide, this article argues that there is an accelerated pace towards the erosion of the political, cultural, linguistic and social distinctiveness of the native population. The article reflects on how India‚Äôs unchecked sovereignty over Kashmir, its unilateral abrogation of the special status of the region within the Indian polity and its post-abrogation settler-colonial strategies are arguably aimed at frustrating the outcome of a prospective self-determination exercise covered under UN Security Council resolutions on the Kashmir situation.

In the first place, it emphasizes respecting the just rights of a community (Kashmiris) seeking self-determination. Secondly, it holds the significance of acknowledging and addressing the gross human rights violations in IIOJK. Thirdly, it reaffirms that the Kashmiri struggle for freedom is indeed a struggle against tyranny, surveillance, media blackouts, land dispossession, and at large the ongoing settler colonialism. Lastly, it calls upon the United Nations and the international community to reiterate the need to stop Indian authorities and security forces from undergoing genocide of Kashmiris since 1947.Kashmir, a place of infinite beauty, but a disputed territory, is in a state of constant bloodshed, fear, and destruction. With millions of Kashmiris killed, women raped, children wounded and various properties damaged, the valley has turned into a nightmare for thousands of Kashmiris suffering from extrajudicial killings, illegal imprisonments, detentions, and forced disappearances.

But beneath the scenic beauty is a harsh and unsettling reality ‚Äî composed of a military occupation, oppression of the entire population and expression of fear, loathing and anger by the people of Kashmir.

For the last seven decades, Kashmir has been the epicenter of a bitter dispute between India and Pakistan in which the people in Jammu are an integral party. To resolve the conflict, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 47 in 1948, and more than a dozen subsequent resolutions, stipulating that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir would be decided by its people through a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the UN. This was accepted by India and Pakistan and, in accordance with Article 25 of the UN Charter, both parties are obligated to implement these resolutions.

This non-binding referendum, organized by the group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), seeks to gather global Sikh sentiment regarding the establishment of Khalistan, a separate state carved out from the Indian state of Punjab. While the referendum itself does not carry any legal weight, the consequences can be felt across the Sikh diaspora worldwide. This blog discusses the potential consequences of the movement and its impact on a global scale. Table of Contents The Background and Motivations for the Khalistan Referendum 2024 The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement that seeks to create an independent Sikh state called ‚ÄúKhalistan‚Äù in the Punjab region of India. Its origins can be traced back to the historical grievances of Sikhs during and after British colonial rule, with dissatisfaction over political, economic, and social issues that persisted into the post-independence period. Tensions particularly escalated in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by demands for greater autonomy for Punjab and resentment towards the central government. The movement gained significant momentum with the rise of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh militant who gained immense popularity. Bhindrawale and his followers caused huge mayhem in Punjab, with several killings and violent incidents. The conflict between Sikh militants and the Central Government reached its peak in 1984 with Operation Blue Star, a military action ordered by the Indian government to remove Bhindrawale and other militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar, leading to hundreds of casualties. This operation led to a deep sense of anger and resentment among Sikhs, especially due to the temple‚Äôs damage.

The New York-based lawyer, believed to be in his early 50s, is the legal counsel and spokesman for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a US-based Sikh separatist group that's banned in India since 2019.In the days following the sensational allegation, Delhi said Pannun ""is wanted for violation of the law"" but denied that they had anything to do with the murder plot. ""A high-level inquiry committee has been formed to investigate the allegation and address the US government's security concerns,"" external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.So who is Pannun and why is he so controversial in India?Delhi has made no bones about its dislike for the Sikh separatist - a man they designated a terrorist in 2020. He is wanted in nearly two dozen cases, including some of terrorism and sedition, and in September, his properties in Amritsar and Chandigarh cities were seized. Pannun denies all the charges and says the cases are false. A Sikh - a religious minority which makes up about 2% of India's population - he says he is an activist who just believes in Khalistan.

Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the founder and legal adviser of the US-based Khalistani organisation Sikhs for Justice, at a press conference in New York in 2014. In July this year, the home ministry designated Pannun, who enjoys little support in Punjab or outside, as a terrorist. JEWEL SAMAD / AFP / Getty Images Jatinder Kaur Tur 15 October, 2020 Thanks for reading The Caravan. If you find our work valuable, consider subscribing or contributing to The Caravan. Within a year of amending the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, in August 2019, to empower the central government to designate individuals as terrorists, the home ministry has notified 13 terrorists‚Äîfour Muslims and nine Sikhs. On 1 July, the ministry issued a batch of notifications under the new provision, identifying nine new individuals, each associated with different Khalistani organisations, as terrorists. The designation of one among these nine, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, raises questions about the threshold for being branded a terrorist, and whether the home ministry has portrayed a man without local support or presence as a greater threat than he actually poses.

Muivah, Ato Kilonser, NSCN/GPRN Public Space 14th August 2023 Th. Muivah Ato Kilonser, NSCN/GPRN My dear countrymen! On this historic 77th Independence Day Celebration, I greet you all my fellow compatriots in the precious name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. In this auspicious national occasion let us give thanks to the Lord God, the Creator of the heaven and the earth, who has done marvellous works for the Nagas in their national struggle for freedom. In every difficult time the Lord has never abandoned the Nagas. He has been with us in all fronts ‚Äì in the military front, diplomatic front, political front and the spiritual front as well. We Nagas are proud of our past dynamic leaders who took the right decision in declaring the Naga National Independence on the 14th August, 1947 on the eve of the British departure from the British India. It was a historic step that gives new meaning to the Naga National identity and saved the future of the Nagas. In yet another challenging moment, the Naga people reaffirmed their national decision to remain a sovereign independence Nagalim rejecting the offer of Union of India and that of the Burma. I adore and salute those visionary leaders and the revolutionary generations. Immediately after rejection of Union of India by the Nagas, the Indian aggression on Nagalim started resulting in massacre, mass torture, summary execution, mass rape, and mass detention in concentration camps, destruction of villages, Churches, schools and forests. Nevertheless, the Naga people could withstand all those horrible persecutions and oppressions perpetrated against them and survived by the grace of God. History is the living witness. I pay homage to all those martyrs. At every stage of the movement, the Naga people have no dearth of revolutionary patriots who can lead the nation in the right direction against all odds.

Until the mid-19th century, the term Kashmir denoted only the Kashmir Valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range. The term has since also come to encompass a larger area that formerly comprised the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, and includes the Indian-administered territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.[1][2][3] The Lidder river valley near Pahalgam Nanga Parbat in Diamer, the ninth-highest mountain on Earth, is the western anchor of the Himalayas In 1819, the Sikh Empire, under Ranjit Singh, annexed the Kashmir valley.[4] In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Jammu and Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage)[5][6] of the British Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: China, India, and Pakistan.[1][7][8][2] Etymology The word Kashmir is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as k√°≈õmƒ´ra.[9] A popular local etymology of Kashmir is that it is land desiccated from water.[10] An alternative etymology derives the name from the name of th",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T19:19:20.929810,"[""occupied kashmir""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,low,english,pakistan,website,0.0

Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part.Today it remains one of the most militarised zones in the world. China administers parts of the territory. The population of historic Kashmir is divided into about 10 million people in Indian-administrated Jammu and Kashmir and 4.5 million in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. There are a further 1.8 million people in the Gilgit-Baltistan autonomous territory, which Pakistan created from northern Kashmir and the two small princely states of Hunza and Nagar in 1970.See more country profiles, external - Profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring, externalHISTORY SINCE 1947When India and Pakistan gained independence from British rule in 1947, the various princely rulers were able to choose which state to join. The Maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh, was the Hindu head of a majority Muslim state sandwiched between the two countries and could not decide. He signed an interim ""standstill"" agreement to maintain transport and other services with Pakistan.In October 1947 tribesmen from Pakistan invaded Kashmir, spurred by reports of attacks on Muslims and frustrated by Hari Singh's delaying tactics. The Maharaja asked for Indian military assistance.India's governor-general, Lord Mountbatten, believed peace would best be served by Kashmir's joining India on a temporary basis, pending a vote on its ultimate status. Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession that month, ceding control over foreign and defence policy to India.

Until the mid-19th century, the term Kashmir geographically denoted only the valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Then the name was used for the larger area of a princely state centered on the valley. Today, that area is divided between India, Pakistan, and China. Kashmir's total land area is 225,000 km2 (87,000 mi2), larger than 87 member countries of the United Nations and all but ten states in the US; it is only slightly smaller than the UK (243,000 km2). In the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism. Nature has lavishly endowed Kashmir with certain distinctive features that are paralleled by few alpine regions in the world. It is a land of snow clad mountains known for its extravagant natural beauty and contained major caravan routes in ancient times. Regions[edit] While Kashmir is disputed, each region is described as part of the country which has de facto control. This should not be seen as a political endorsement of any claim.

2025-08-28T19:20:02.546002,Khalistan movement - Wikipedia,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Sikh separatist movement in the Punjab region The proposed flag of Khalistan is often used as a symbol of the Khalistan movement.[1] The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement seeking to create a homeland for Sikhs by establishing an ethno-religious sovereign state called Khalistan[A] (lit. 'land of the Khalsa') in the Punjab region.[2] The proposed boundaries of Khalistan vary between different groups; some suggest the entirety of the Sikh-majority Indian state of Punjab, while larger claims include Pakistani Punjab and other parts of North India such as Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.[3] The call for a separate Sikh state began during the 1930s, when British rule in India was nearing its end.[4] In 1940, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in a pamphlet titled ""Khalistan"".[5][6] In the 1940s, a demand for a Sikh country called 'Sikhistan' arose.[7] With financial and political support from the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab ‚Äì which has a Sikh-majority population ‚Äì continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, and reaching its zenith in the late 1980s. The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter affirmed his support for the Khalistan movement in retaliation for the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, which resulted in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan.[8] The insurgency in Punjab started in the early 1980s after 1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clash.[9][10] Several Pro-Khalistan groups were involved in the armed insurgency, including Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Commando Force, among others.[11] In 1986, Khalistan Commando Force took responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Vaidya, in retaliation for 1984's Operation Blue Star.[12][13] By the mid-1990s, the insurgency petered out, with the last major incident being the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh, who was killed in a bomb blast by a member of ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T19:20:02.516630,"[""Hindu nationalism"", ""kashmir liberation"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.008596234849136079

2025-08-28T19:20:18.060309,The Khalistan Movement in Canada: A Political Consensus - MP-IDSA,"Introduction On 22 July 2024, the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton was vandalised by the Khalistan separatists with hateful and anti-India graffiti.1 This incident occurred on the heels of another incident on 19 June 2024 wherein the Canadian parliament observed a minute‚Äôs silence on the first death anniversary of designated Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. A moment of silence in the parliament reflects an unequivocal consensus among representatives of all the political parties in the House of Commons.2 Such non-partisan consensus vis-√†-vis Khalistani separatists has not been uncommon in Canada. Since the early 1980s, the Canadian political landscape, irrespective of the political parties in power, has been permissive, if not sympathetic, to the Khalistan movement. The driving forces behind such political consensus have ranged from Cold War dynamics before 1990s to domestic politics at present. For years, successive Canadian governments, regardless of the political parties in power, have demonstrated a tendency to overlook Indian security concerns and have adopted a lenient approach towards Khalistan-related activities. While doing so, the Canadian government‚Äôs attitude has been shaped by three overarching factors‚ÄîCold War dynamics; political stance on freedom of expression; and considerations of vote bank politics. Cold War Era Dynamics During the Cold War, in alignment with other Western countries, Canada engaged with India through various bilateral avenues such as project financing, food aid and technical assistance. This was exemplified by the establishment of the CIRUS nuclear reactor at the Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment in 1954. However, bilateral relations between the two nations experienced a downturn following India‚Äôs peaceful nuclear explosion in 1974 with fissile materials sourced from the aforementioned reactor.

Since the 1980s, radical separatists have spearheaded a bloody campaign to carve out an independent, theocratic Sikh state in India known as Khalistan (Land of the Pure). Despite being dormant in India, the Khalistan movement has recently surged vigorously in the Western diaspora. Khalistani extremists have actively used American, Canadian, and British soil for their cause and grown increasingly violent. In the past year alone, Khalistanis attacked both the Consulate General of India in San Francisco and India High Commission in London and vandalized temples in New York City, in the Toronto area Australia, and California. The FBI, DEA, and United States Customs Service (USCS) have conducted numerous investigations into the activities of pro-Khalistan extremists in the US. Download our Khalistan brief for law enforcement here LISTEN: THAT'S SO HINDU History of the Khalistani Movement‚Äôs Aims and Methods The roots of Khalistan lie in the British colonial policies of the late 1800s and early 1900s that sought to divide Sikhs and Hindus. Sikhs were recruited into the British army in large numbers to use against Hindu rulers that rebelled against the British Raj. Subsequently, after Indian independence in 1947, tensions between the state of Punjab and the central Indian government surfaced, leading to grievances amongst many Sikhs against the Indian government. Punjab, for instance, was trifurcated into the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh in 1966, along linguistic lines (Punjab as a Punjabi speaking state, and Haryana and Himachal Pradesh as Hindi speaking states), which created resentment amongst many Sikhs that the historic contours of Punjab were being further divided after it has already been divided between India and Pakistan in 1947. Many Sikhs in Punjab also resented sharing the joint capital of Chandigarh with Haryana, and viewed water sharing agreements with Haryana ",https://www.hinduamerican.org/khalistan/,www.hinduamerican.org,2025-08-28T19:20:19.381128,"[""anti-India"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.hinduamerican.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.05234231876472127

India has denied the allegations from Canada, describing them as ""absurd"". After the US allegations emerged, India said it had formed a high-level inquiry committee to address them. For anyone new to this long-running controversy, here's an at-a-glance look at the history and current context:Who are Sikhs and where do they live?Sikhism is one of the world's major religions, founded in the 16th Century in the Punjab region of what is now India and Pakistan - which was divided between the two countries after the end of British rule in 1947.There are around 25 million Sikhs worldwide, making it the fifth largest faith group. The vast majority live in India, where they make up around 2% of the country's 1.4bn people. But significant diaspora populations exist as well.Canada is home to the largest population outside India, with around 780,000 Sikh people - more than 2% of the country's population - while both the US and UK are home to around 500,000 and Australia around 200,000.

The Khalistan movement was explicitly hyped to develop general moral consensus by nurturing anti-Sikh sentiments by Committee for State Security KGB by depicting the Sikh leadership as anti-Hindus. The obstacles for the Soviet Union in India were the Sikhs because of their resistance against Soviet policies towards religion; declassified documents reveal that USSR indoctrination of Indira Gandhi turned India into a Vassal State of the Soviets, furthering to achieve the mass scale invasion of Pakistan through Punjab under the banner of India liberation for Khalistan; for that KGB manufactured documents of the Punjab Secession movement, known as the Khalistan movement and laid down the foundation of India‚Äôs destruction.

Canada is investigating possible links between the Indian government and the assassination of Khalistan Tiger Force (KTF) chief Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. The Canadian government also said that it has expelled a top Indian diplomat as a consequence. What is the Khalistan movement? About The Khalistan movement is a fight for a separate, sovereign Sikh state in present day Punjab (both India and Pakistan). The movement was crushed in India following Operation Blue Star (1984) and Operation Black Thunder (1986 and 1988). Operation Blue Star began on June 1, 1984 to flush out militants from the Golden Temple and neutralise Bhindranwale. The Khalistan movement is banned in India, where officials see it and its affiliated groups as a national security threat. But the movement still has some support in north India, as well as beyond, in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom which are home to a sizable Sikh diaspora. Khalistan and Canada As per the 2021 Canadian census, Sikhs account for 2.1 per cent of Canada‚Äôs population, and are the country‚Äôs fastest growing religious group.

(AP Photo) by Yousaf Junaid Aug 05, 2025 12:05 am The U.N.-administered plebiscite in Kashmir is vital for sustainable peace in South Asia As the calendar marks Aug. 5, we solemnly observe ""Youm-e Istehsal-e-Kashmir"" (the Day of Exploitation of Kashmir), the day when the Indian government, breaching fundamental international legal norms and rules, illegally and unilaterally revoked articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution. These articles conferred autonomous status upon Kashmir, along with special rights and privileges for the Kashmiris. Though these Indian constitutional guarantees are in no way a substitute for the United Nations-sponsored plebiscite, their revocation was a step toward the Indian colonization drive of Jammu and Kashmir and steps to alter the ground realities in gross violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions. A ploy that India has learnt from Israel‚Äôs actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. These Indian actions are aimed at further enhancing their ongoing repression and systemic marginalization of the Kashmiri people. The observance of Aug. 5 serves as a stark reminder of the enduring struggle for self-determination and justice, and calls upon the international community to fulfill the promise made to the Kashmiri people by the U.N. Security Council (UNSC), i.e, the right to self-determination. Indian occupation of Kashmir The genesis of the Kashmir issue dates back to the partition of British India in 1947, which was based on the principle that regions with Muslim majorities would be part of Pakistan, while those with Hindu majorities would join India.

2025-08-28T19:23:06.544211,Kashmir: The Clash of Identities | Beyond Intractability,"By Neha Navlakha March, 2009 Summary Kashmir is a divided state. Two of its regions are controlled by Pakistan and three regions are controlled by India. Both countries, however, lay claim to the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmiri people themselves have long been striving for autonomy and ultimately independence. At its core therefore, this is a conflict that is both intrastate and interstate in its nature. The insurgency began in 1988 initiated by young nationalists from Jammu Kashmir Liberation Force (JKLF) - who crossed over to Pakistan to get trained and armed - supported by Kashmiris who took to the streets to call for a plebiscite after years of being forced to abide by the wishes and rules imposed by the central government. India labeled the insurgency a proxy war by Pakistan and responded with force.[1] In response to the insurgency, India introduced direct rule in 1990. Security forces moved in, the Kashmiri civil administration - education, services, courts, etc. - collapsed, leading to further suffering, discontent and increased despair in the valley. The desperate situation in Kashmir influenced more young Kashmiris to join the militants, as they could see no nonviolent avenue to initiate change. The militant groups thereby grew in size and also turned more Islamist. This was particularly evident after the cease-fire in 1994, as groups such as Lashkar-e-Toiba joined, bringing hardened fighters from Afghanistan, which today form the core of the militants.[2] After three wars - in 1947, 1965 and 1971 - a serious armed conflict in 1999 in Kargil and a UN resolution promising plebiscite, the conflict is still far from over. Despite numerous attempts at finding a solution, parties to the conflict have repeatedly failed at finding an alternative that would satisfy everyone involved.[3] Ultimately, the Kashmir conflict embodies a complex amalgamation of religious, nationalist and political factors which are deeply rooted in history.

Across the country, Muslims have found themselves in the crosshairs of a society baying for blood, and calling for revenge against Pakistan. When India began its airstrikes against Pakistan earlier this week, the vitriol didn‚Äôt stop. It became louder. More obscene. It was as if an entire country united in the call for more blood and more retaliation.

Is Islam irrelevant for Muslims when they are engaged in a struggle that consumes their lives and permeates their entire existence? Or can Islam constitute the lifeblood of the struggle that Muslims lead against the condition of colonization? The long struggle of Kashmiri Muslims against India‚Äôs occupation tells us that not only is Islam a source of support and hope for a community of Muslims facing fierce oppression, it is also the light that guides the struggle of Kashmiris, the language that defines their quest for justice and the promise that makes surrender unimaginable.A few days back, my 61-year-old mother, who has been in prison for more than 12 years for her involvement with the resistance movement, called my aunt from Tihar Jail, Delhi.

The speakers included Dr. Hafsa Kanjwal and the chair ‚Äì Francis Cody. Dr. Kanjwal is an Associate Professor of South Asian History at Lafayette College in Eaton, Pennsylvania. As a modern Kashmir historian, she authored Colonizing Kashmir: State-Building Under Indian Occupation. Esmat Elhalaby is an affiliate of the Centre for South Asian Studies at the Asian Institute and Assistant Professor of Transnational History at the Department of Historical and Cultural Studies. He works principally on the intellectual history of West and South Asia. Before a summary and discussion of the book began, Kanjwal led a brief abstract on her deliberation while writing it. She explored how the text was based on years of research and dialogue with Kashmiri residents on the conditions of Indian occupation between the 1950s and 1980s. Her motivation behind publishing the book was to open dialogue in academia and politics on rethinking colonization by colonized people, understand the intricate sociopolitical dynamics in the Global South, and deliberate on nation-states‚Äô impacts overarchingly. To set the stage for her main arguments, Kanjwal began the discussion with a history lesson on the beginnings of the Indian occupation of Kashmir. She explained how the United Nations ordained a plebiscite to resolve the issue following the partition. However, forces from both Pakistan and India were unrelenting in removing their troops from the occupied territories, and a plebiscite has not occurred since. To strengthen its influence in Kashmir, the Indian government staged a coup to bring Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed to power.

Nehru, speaking of the character of Kashmiris, writes: ‚ÄúIt must be remembered that the people of the Kashmir Valley and round about, though highly gifted in many ways‚Äîin intelligence, in artisanship, etc.‚Äîare not what are called a virile people.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúThey are soft and addicted to easy living. . . . The common people are primarily interested in a few things‚Äîan honest administration and cheap and adequate food. If they get this, then they are more or less content.‚Äù2 That Kashmiris had been brought to starvation and famine a number of times in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did not seem to factor into Nehru‚Äôs patronizing understanding of them as being ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúaddicted to easy living.‚Äù The parallels between British colonial attitudes toward Indians as unmanly and lacking virility and Nehru‚Äôs understandings of Kashmiris should not be surprising, the latter‚Äôs ironic reputation as an anti-colonial nationalist (and being of Kashmiri descent himself) notwithstanding.3 These attitudes are fundamental to the process of colonial domination.A year later, the Indian state, with the cooperation of several Kashmiri leaders, turned against Sheikh Abdullah, who, despite pl",https://www.sup.org/books/asian-studies/colonizing-kashmir/excerpt/introduction,www.sup.org,2025-08-28T19:23:37.358912,"[""anti-India"", ""Hindu nationalism"", ""occupied kashmir""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.sup.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.006914194842010648

DAWN VIA PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT As the sun rises over the picturesque landscape of Kashmir, it‚Äôs easy to believe that all is well in the region. But beneath the scenic beauty is a harsh and unsettling reality ‚Äî composed of a military occupation, oppression of the entire population and expression of fear, loathing and anger by the people of Kashmir. The picture that the Indian government tries to paint ‚Äî of normalcy and development in occupied Jammu and Kashmir ‚Äî is a myth. For the last seven decades, Kashmir has been the epicenter of a bitter dispute between India and Pakistan in which the people in Jammu are an integral party. To resolve the conflict, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 47 in 1948, and more than a dozen subsequent resolutions, stipulating that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir would be decided by its people through a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the UN. This was accepted by India and Pakistan and, in accordance with Article 25 of the UN Charter, both parties are obligated to implement these resolutions. But this Saturday, Aug. 5, marks four years of India‚Äôs unilateral actions to consolidate its occupation of Illegally Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and imposing what India‚Äôs leaders have ominously called a ‚Äúfinal solution‚Äù for Kashmir.

This non-binding referendum, organized by the group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), seeks to gather global Sikh sentiment regarding the establishment of Khalistan, a separate state carved out from the Indian state of Punjab. While the referendum itself does not carry any legal weight, the consequences can be felt across the Sikh diaspora worldwide. This blog discusses the potential consequences of the movement and its impact on a global scale. Table of Contents The Background and Motivations for the Khalistan Referendum 2024 The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement that seeks to create an independent Sikh state called ‚ÄúKhalistan‚Äù in the Punjab region of India. Its origins can be traced back to the historical grievances of Sikhs during and after British colonial rule, with dissatisfaction over political, economic, and social issues that persisted into the post-independence period. Tensions particularly escalated in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by demands for greater autonomy for Punjab and resentment towards the central government. The movement gained significant momentum with the rise of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh militant who gained immense popularity. Bhindrawale and his followers caused huge mayhem in Punjab, with several killings and violent incidents. The conflict between Sikh militants and the Central Government reached its peak in 1984 with Operation Blue Star, a military action ordered by the Indian government to remove Bhindrawale and other militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar, leading to hundreds of casualties. This operation led to a deep sense of anger and resentment among Sikhs, especially due to the temple‚Äôs damage.

The New York-based lawyer, believed to be in his early 50s, is the legal counsel and spokesman for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a US-based Sikh separatist group that's banned in India since 2019.In the days following the sensational allegation, Delhi said Pannun ""is wanted for violation of the law"" but denied that they had anything to do with the murder plot.

He is wanted in nearly two dozen cases, including some of terrorism and sedition, and in September, his properties in Amritsar and Chandigarh cities were seized. Pannun denies all the charges and says the cases are false. A Sikh - a religious minority which makes up about 2% of India's population - he says he is an activist who just believes in Khalistan.

The first Khalistan referendum was held on October 31, 2021, in the UK, in which 30,000 Sikhs participated. Over 6,000 people voted for a sovereign Sikh state in Geneva on December 10, last year.

The referendum in Canada was organised by the Sikh for Justice (SFJ) under the leadership of Sikh leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannu in a peaceful and democratic way. During interaction with media outlets, Gurpatwant Singh showed a proposed Khalistan Map with Shimla as its capital. The huge turnout for the Sikh Referendum depicts that the issue of the Sikh independence movement is becoming a mainstream movement. During the referendum, the Sikh community raised anti-India and pro-Khalistan slogans and more than 2,000 cars took part in the pro-Khalistan rally.

Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the founder and legal adviser of the US-based Khalistani organisation Sikhs for Justice, at a press conference in New York in 2014. In July this year, the home ministry designated Pannun, who enjoys little support in Punjab or outside, as a terrorist. JEWEL SAMAD / AFP / Getty Images Jatinder Kaur Tur 15 October, 2020 Thanks for reading The Caravan. If you find our work valuable, consider subscribing or contributing to The Caravan. Within a year of amending the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, in August 2019, to empower the central government to designate individuals as terrorists, the home ministry has notified 13 terrorists‚Äîfour Muslims and nine Sikhs. On 1 July, the ministry issued a batch of notifications under the new provision, identifying nine new individuals, each associated with different Khalistani organisations, as terrorists. The designation of one among these nine, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, raises questions about the threshold for being branded a terrorist, and whether the home ministry has portrayed a man without local support or presence as a greater threat than he actually poses. Pannun is a founder and the legal adviser of Sikhs for Justice, a United States-based Khalistani secessionist group that was declared an unlawful organisation under the UAPA in July 2019.

2025-08-28T19:34:26.781544,Khalistan movement - Wikipedia,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Sikh separatist movement in the Punjab region The proposed flag of Khalistan is often used as a symbol of the Khalistan movement.[1] The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement seeking to create a homeland for Sikhs by establishing an ethno-religious sovereign state called Khalistan[A] (lit. 'land of the Khalsa') in the Punjab region.[2] The proposed boundaries of Khalistan vary between different groups; some suggest the entirety of the Sikh-majority Indian state of Punjab, while larger claims include Pakistani Punjab and other parts of North India such as Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.[3] The call for a separate Sikh state began during the 1930s, when British rule in India was nearing its end.[4] In 1940, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in a pamphlet titled ""Khalistan"".[5][6] In the 1940s, a demand for a Sikh country called 'Sikhistan' arose.[7] With financial and political support from the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab ‚Äì which has a Sikh-majority population ‚Äì continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, and reaching its zenith in the late 1980s. The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter affirmed his support for the Khalistan movement in retaliation for the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, which resulted in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan.[8] The insurgency in Punjab started in the early 1980s after 1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clash.[9][10] Several Pro-Khalistan groups were involved in the armed insurgency, including Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Commando Force, among others.[11] In 1986, Khalistan Commando Force took responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Vaidya, in retaliation for 1984's Operation Blue Star.[12][13] By the mid-1990s, the insurgency petered out, with the last major incident being the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh, who was killed in a bomb blast by a member of ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T19:34:26.702379,"[""Hindu nationalism"", ""kashmir liberation"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.008596234849136079

2025-08-28T19:34:37.592742,The Khalistan Movement in Canada: A Political Consensus - MP-IDSA,"Introduction On 22 July 2024, the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton was vandalised by the Khalistan separatists with hateful and anti-India graffiti.1 This incident occurred on the heels of another incident on 19 June 2024 wherein the Canadian parliament observed a minute‚Äôs silence on the first death anniversary of designated Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. A moment of silence in the parliament reflects an unequivocal consensus among representatives of all the political parties in the House of Commons.2 Such non-partisan consensus vis-√†-vis Khalistani separatists has not been uncommon in Canada. Since the early 1980s, the Canadian political landscape, irrespective of the political parties in power, has been permissive, if not sympathetic, to the Khalistan movement. The driving forces behind such political consensus have ranged from Cold War dynamics before 1990s to domestic politics at present. For years, successive Canadian governments, regardless of the political parties in power, have demonstrated a tendency to overlook Indian security concerns and have adopted a lenient approach towards Khalistan-related activities. While doing so, the Canadian government‚Äôs attitude has been shaped by three overarching factors‚ÄîCold War dynamics; political stance on freedom of expression; and considerations of vote bank politics. Cold War Era Dynamics During the Cold War, in alignment with other Western countries, Canada engaged with India through various bilateral avenues such as project financing, food aid and technical assistance. This was exemplified by the establishment of the CIRUS nuclear reactor at the Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment in 1954. However, bilateral relations between the two nations experienced a downturn following India‚Äôs peaceful nuclear explosion in 1974 with fissile materials sourced from the aforementioned reactor. During this phase (1970s‚Äì1980s), the Liberal Party government of Pierre Trudeau and subsequent government of Progressive Con",https://www.idsa.in/publisher/comments/the-khalistan-movement-in-canada-a-political-consensus,www.idsa.in,2025-08-28T19:34:37.570099,"[""anti-India"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.idsa.in,0,high,english,canada,website,0.0

Since the 1980s, radical separatists have spearheaded a bloody campaign to carve out an independent, theocratic Sikh state in India known as Khalistan (Land of the Pure). Despite being dormant in India, the Khalistan movement has recently surged vigorously in the Western diaspora. Khalistani extremists have actively used American, Canadian, and British soil for their cause and grown increasingly violent. In the past year alone, Khalistanis attacked both the Consulate General of India in San Francisco and India High Commission in London and vandalized temples in New York City, in the Toronto area Australia, and California. The FBI, DEA, and United States Customs Service (USCS) have conducted numerous investigations into the activities of pro-Khalistan extremists in the US. Download our Khalistan brief for law enforcement here LISTEN: THAT'S SO HINDU History of the Khalistani Movement‚Äôs Aims and Methods The roots of Khalistan lie in the British colonial policies of the late 1800s and early 1900s that sought to divide Sikhs and Hindus. Sikhs were recruited into the British army in large numbers to use against Hindu rulers that rebelled against the British Raj. Subsequently, after Indian independence in 1947, tensions between the state of Punjab and the central Indian government surfaced, leading to grievances amongst many Sikhs against the Indian government. Punjab, for instance, was trifurcated into the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh in 1966, along linguistic lines (Punjab as a Punjabi speaking state, and Haryana and Himachal Pradesh as Hindi speaking states), which created resentment amongst many Sikhs that the historic contours of Punjab were being further divided after it has already been divided between India and Pakistan in 1947. Many Sikhs in Punjab also resented sharing the joint capital of Chandigarh with Haryana, and viewed water sharing agreements with Haryana ",https://www.hinduamerican.org/khalistan/,www.hinduamerican.org,2025-08-28T19:34:38.831293,"[""anti-India"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.hinduamerican.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.05234231876472127

India has denied the allegations from Canada, describing them as ""absurd"". After the US allegations emerged, India said it had formed a high-level inquiry committee to address them. For anyone new to this long-running controversy, here's an at-a-glance look at the history and current context:Who are Sikhs and where do they live?Sikhism is one of the world's major religions, founded in the 16th Century in the Punjab region of what is now India and Pakistan - which was divided between the two countries after the end of British rule in 1947.There are around 25 million Sikhs worldwide, making it the fifth largest faith group. The vast majority live in India, where they make up around 2% of the country's 1.4bn people. But significant diaspora populations exist as well.Canada is home to the largest population outside India, with around 780,000 Sikh people - more than 2% of the country's population - while both the US and UK are home to around 500,000 and Australia around 200,000. Why are some Sikhs calling for a separate nation?The Khalistan movement calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India.

Chris Helgren/Reuters CNN ‚Äî In the early hours of June 23, 1985, a bomb planted in the cargo hold of Air India flight 182 traveling from Montreal to New Delhi exploded off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people on board. The people arrested and charged for the bomb attack were Indian-born Sikh Canadians, alleged by prosecutors to be radical separatists seeking revenge for the Indian army‚Äôs deadly storming of the Golden Temple in Punjab state the previous year. Only one was convicted; two were acquitted in 2005, and in 2016, Canada released the only person ever found guilty of the bombing. Nearly four decades on, that terrorist attack ‚Äì which remains the worst in Canada‚Äôs history ‚Äì and the wider history of overseas Sikh separatism has suddenly been thrust back into the international spotlight in the wake of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‚Äôs allegations the Indian state may have been involved in the June killing on Canadian soil of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Nijjar‚Äôs supporters rejected the terrorist label, arguing it was used to discredit the Sikh leader, who was known for his Khalistan advocacy and speaking out against alleged human rights abuses by India‚Äôs government. Trudeau‚Äôs assassination claim has inflamed relations with New Delhi, which has fiercely denied the allegation and taken a series of diplomatic measures to make clear its displeasure with Canada.

(AP Photo) by Yousaf Junaid Aug 05, 2025 12:05 am The U.N.-administered plebiscite in Kashmir is vital for sustainable peace in South Asia As the calendar marks Aug. 5, we solemnly observe ""Youm-e Istehsal-e-Kashmir"" (the Day of Exploitation of Kashmir), the day when the Indian government, breaching fundamental international legal norms and rules, illegally and unilaterally revoked articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution. These articles conferred autonomous status upon Kashmir, along with special rights and privileges for the Kashmiris. Though these Indian constitutional guarantees are in no way a substitute for the United Nations-sponsored plebiscite, their revocation was a step toward the Indian colonization drive of Jammu and Kashmir and steps to alter the ground realities in gross violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions. A ploy that India has learnt from Israel‚Äôs actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. These Indian actions are aimed at further enhancing their ongoing repression and systemic marginalization of the Kashmiri people. The observance of Aug. 5 serves as a stark reminder of the enduring struggle for self-determination and justice, and calls upon the international community to fulfill the promise made to the Kashmiri people by the U.N. Security Council (UNSC), i.e, the right to self-determination. Indian occupation of Kashmir The genesis of the Kashmir issue dates back to the partition of British India in 1947, which was based on the principle that regions with Muslim majorities would be part of Pakistan, while those with Hindu majorities would join India.

Across the country, Muslims have found themselves in the crosshairs of a society baying for blood, and calling for revenge against Pakistan. When India began its airstrikes against Pakistan earlier this week, the vitriol didn‚Äôt stop. It became louder. More obscene. It was as if an entire country united in the call for more blood and more retaliation.

The speakers included Dr. Hafsa Kanjwal and the chair ‚Äì Francis Cody. Dr. Kanjwal is an Associate Professor of South Asian History at Lafayette College in Eaton, Pennsylvania. As a modern Kashmir historian, she authored Colonizing Kashmir: State-Building Under Indian Occupation. Esmat Elhalaby is an affiliate of the Centre for South Asian Studies at the Asian Institute and Assistant Professor of Transnational History at the Department of Historical and Cultural Studies. He works principally on the intellectual history of West and South Asia. Before a summary and discussion of the book began, Kanjwal led a brief abstract on her deliberation while writing it. She explored how the text was based on years of research and dialogue with Kashmiri residents on the conditions of Indian occupation between the 1950s and 1980s. Her motivation behind publishing the book was to open dialogue in academia and politics on rethinking colonization by colonized people, understand the intricate sociopolitical dynamics in the Global South, and deliberate on nation-states‚Äô impacts overarchingly. To set the stage for her main arguments, Kanjwal began the discussion with a history lesson on the beginnings of the Indian occupation of Kashmir. She explained how the United Nations ordained a plebiscite to resolve the issue following the partition. However, forces from both Pakistan and India were unrelenting in removing their troops from the occupied territories, and a plebiscite has not occurred since. To strengthen its influence in Kashmir, the Indian government staged a coup to bring Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed to power.

2025-08-28T19:37:12.382325,Kashmir: The Clash of Identities | Beyond Intractability,"By Neha Navlakha March, 2009 Summary Kashmir is a divided state. Two of its regions are controlled by Pakistan and three regions are controlled by India. Both countries, however, lay claim to the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmiri people themselves have long been striving for autonomy and ultimately independence. At its core therefore, this is a conflict that is both intrastate and interstate in its nature. The insurgency began in 1988 initiated by young nationalists from Jammu Kashmir Liberation Force (JKLF) - who crossed over to Pakistan to get trained and armed - supported by Kashmiris who took to the streets to call for a plebiscite after years of being forced to abide by the wishes and rules imposed by the central government. India labeled the insurgency a proxy war by Pakistan and responded with force.[1] In response to the insurgency, India introduced direct rule in 1990. Security forces moved in, the Kashmiri civil administration - education, services, courts, etc. - collapsed, leading to further suffering, discontent and increased despair in the valley. The desperate situation in Kashmir influenced more young Kashmiris to join the militants, as they could see no nonviolent avenue to initiate change. The militant groups thereby grew in size and also turned more Islamist. This was particularly evident after the cease-fire in 1994, as groups such as Lashkar-e-Toiba joined, bringing hardened fighters from Afghanistan, which today form the core of the militants.[2] After three wars - in 1947, 1965 and 1971 - a serious armed conflict in 1999 in Kargil and a UN resolution promising plebiscite, the conflict is still far from over. Despite numerous attempts at finding a solution, parties to the conflict have repeatedly failed at finding an alternative that would satisfy everyone involved.[3] Ultimately, the Kashmir conflict embodies a complex amalgamation of religious, nationalist and political factors which are deeply rooted in history.

Nehru, speaking of the character of Kashmiris, writes: ‚ÄúIt must be remembered that the people of the Kashmir Valley and round about, though highly gifted in many ways‚Äîin intelligence, in artisanship, etc.‚Äîare not what are called a virile people.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúThey are soft and addicted to easy living. . . . The common people are primarily interested in a few things‚Äîan honest administration and cheap and adequate food. If they get this, then they are more or less content.‚Äù2 That Kashmiris had been brought to starvation and famine a number of times in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did not seem to factor into Nehru‚Äôs patronizing understanding of them as being ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúaddicted to easy living.‚Äù The parallels between British colonial attitudes toward Indians as unmanly and lacking virility and Nehru‚Äôs understandings of Kashmiris should not be surprising, the latter‚Äôs ironic reputation as an anti-colonial nationalist (and being of Kashmiri descent himself) notwithstanding.3 These attitudes are fundamental to the process of colonial domination.A year later, the Indian state, with the cooperation of several Kashmiri leaders, turned against Sheikh Abdullah, who, despite pl",https://www.sup.org/books/asian-studies/colonizing-kashmir/excerpt/introduction,www.sup.org,2025-08-28T19:37:30.863919,"[""anti-India"", ""Hindu nationalism"", ""occupied kashmir""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.sup.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.006914194842010648

In the Indian Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared, ‚ÄúA new era has begun . . . an era of progress and prosperity‚Äù (Ward 2019). In Kashmir, however, Indian forces had preemptively arrested thousands, shut down the phones and the internet, and forced Kashmiris to stay inside their homes.

In violation of the Indian Independence Act and the Partition Plan, which gave the people of the former British colonies the right to self-determination, India moved soldiers into the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir on this day. Subsequently, India has employed a range of tactics to strengthen its unlawful and illegitimate rule over Kashmir, including altering the region's demographic makeup, stifling its political ambitions, infringing upon its human rights, and erasing its cultural and historical identity.AmaraDespite UN resolutions, the right to self-determination has not been granted to the Kashmiri people. India has violently suppressed them, denied them fundamental freedoms, and violated their human rights.

The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage)[5][6] of the British Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: China, India, and Pakistan.[1][7][8][2] Etymology The word Kashmir is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as k√°≈õmƒ´ra.[9] A popular local etymology of Kashmir is that it is land desiccated from water.[10] An alternative etymology derives the name from the name of th",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T19:39:14.010913,"[""occupied kashmir""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,low,english,pakistan,website,0.0

'land of the Khalsa') in the Punjab region.[2] The proposed boundaries of Khalistan vary between different groups; some suggest the entirety of the Sikh-majority Indian state of Punjab, while larger claims include Pakistani Punjab and other parts of North India such as Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.[3] The call for a separate Sikh state began during the 1930s, when British rule in India was nearing its end.[4] In 1940, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in a pamphlet titled ""Khalistan"".[5][6] In the 1940s, a demand for a Sikh country called 'Sikhistan' arose.[7] With financial and political support from the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab ‚Äì which has a Sikh-majority population ‚Äì continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, and reaching its zenith in the late 1980s. The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter affirmed his support for the Khalistan movement in retaliation for the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, which resulted in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan.[8] The insurgency in Punjab started in the early 1980s after 1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clash.[9][10] Several Pro-Khalistan groups were involved in the armed insurgency, including Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Commando Force, among others.[11] In 1986, Khalistan Commando Force took responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Vaidya, in retaliation for 1984's Operation Blue Star.[12][13] By the mid-1990s, the insurgency petered out, with the last major incident being the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh, who was killed in a bomb blast by a member of ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T19:40:11.285801,"[""Hindu nationalism"", ""kashmir liberation"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.008596234849136079

2025-08-28T19:40:24.223089,The Khalistan Movement in Canada: A Political Consensus - MP-IDSA,"Introduction On 22 July 2024, the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton was vandalised by the Khalistan separatists with hateful and anti-India graffiti.1 This incident occurred on the heels of another incident on 19 June 2024 wherein the Canadian parliament observed a minute‚Äôs silence on the first death anniversary of designated Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. A moment of silence in the parliament reflects an unequivocal consensus among representatives of all the political parties in the House of Commons.2 Such non-partisan consensus vis-√†-vis Khalistani separatists has not been uncommon in Canada. Since the early 1980s, the Canadian political landscape, irrespective of the political parties in power, has been permissive, if not sympathetic, to the Khalistan movement. The driving forces behind such political consensus have ranged from Cold War dynamics before 1990s to domestic politics at present. For years, successive Canadian governments, regardless of the political parties in power, have demonstrated a tendency to overlook Indian security concerns and have adopted a lenient approach towards Khalistan-related activities. While doing so, the Canadian government‚Äôs attitude has been shaped by three overarching factors‚ÄîCold War dynamics; political stance on freedom of expression; and considerations of vote bank politics. Cold War Era Dynamics During the Cold War, in alignment with other Western countries, Canada engaged with India through various bilateral avenues such as project financing, food aid and technical assistance. This was exemplified by the establishment of the CIRUS nuclear reactor at the Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment in 1954. However, bilateral relations between the two nations experienced a downturn following India‚Äôs peaceful nuclear explosion in 1974 with fissile materials sourced from the aforementioned reactor.

Since the 1980s, radical separatists have spearheaded a bloody campaign to carve out an independent, theocratic Sikh state in India known as Khalistan (Land of the Pure). Despite being dormant in India, the Khalistan movement has recently surged vigorously in the Western diaspora. Khalistani extremists have actively used American, Canadian, and British soil for their cause and grown increasingly violent. In the past year alone, Khalistanis attacked both the Consulate General of India in San Francisco and India High Commission in London and vandalized temples in New York City, in the Toronto area Australia, and California. The FBI, DEA, and United States Customs Service (USCS) have conducted numerous investigations into the activities of pro-Khalistan extremists in the US. Download our Khalistan brief for law enforcement here LISTEN: THAT'S SO HINDU History of the Khalistani Movement‚Äôs Aims and Methods The roots of Khalistan lie in the British colonial policies of the late 1800s and early 1900s that sought to divide Sikhs and Hindus. Sikhs were recruited into the British army in large numbers to use against Hindu rulers that rebelled against the British Raj. Subsequently, after Indian independence in 1947, tensions between the state of Punjab and the central Indian government surfaced, leading to grievances amongst many Sikhs against the Indian government. Punjab, for instance, was trifurcated into the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh in 1966, along linguistic lines (Punjab as a Punjabi speaking state, and Haryana and Himachal Pradesh as Hindi speaking states), which created resentment amongst many Sikhs that the historic contours of Punjab were being further divided after it has already been divided between India and Pakistan in 1947.

India has denied the allegations from Canada, describing them as ""absurd"". After the US allegations emerged, India said it had formed a high-level inquiry committee to address them. For anyone new to this long-running controversy, here's an at-a-glance look at the history and current context:Who are Sikhs and where do they live?Sikhism is one of the world's major religions, founded in the 16th Century in the Punjab region of what is now India and Pakistan - which was divided between the two countries after the end of British rule in 1947.There are around 25 million Sikhs worldwide, making it the fifth largest faith group. The vast majority live in India, where they make up around 2% of the country's 1.4bn people. But significant diaspora populations exist as well.Canada is home to the largest population outside India, with around 780,000 Sikh people - more than 2% of the country's population - while both the US and UK are home to around 500,000 and Australia around 200,000. Why are some Sikhs calling for a separate nation?The Khalistan movement calls for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India. The movement was at its peak in the 1980s in the Indian state of Punjab, when the area experienced a series of violent attacks and thousands of deaths.It lost steam after Indian armed forces ran",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-66852291,www.bbc.com,2025-08-28T19:40:27.921329,"[""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.bbc.com,0,medium,english,pakistan,website,-0.41928721174004197

Chris Helgren/Reuters CNN ‚Äî In the early hours of June 23, 1985, a bomb planted in the cargo hold of Air India flight 182 traveling from Montreal to New Delhi exploded off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people on board. The people arrested and charged for the bomb attack were Indian-born Sikh Canadians, alleged by prosecutors to be radical separatists seeking revenge for the Indian army‚Äôs deadly storming of the Golden Temple in Punjab state the previous year. Only one was convicted; two were acquitted in 2005, and in 2016, Canada released the only person ever found guilty of the bombing. Nearly four decades on, that terrorist attack ‚Äì which remains the worst in Canada‚Äôs history ‚Äì and the wider history of overseas Sikh separatism has suddenly been thrust back into the international spotlight in the wake of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‚Äôs allegations the Indian state may have been involved in the June killing on Canadian soil of Hardeep Singh Nijjar.

Nijjar‚Äôs supporters rejected the terrorist label, arguing it was used to discredit the Sikh leader, who was known for his Khalistan advocacy and speaking out against alleged human rights abuses by India‚Äôs government.

The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage)[5][6] of the British Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: China, India, and Pakistan.[1][7][8][2] Etymology The word Kashmir is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as k√°≈õmƒ´ra.[9] A popular local etymology of Kashmir is that it is land desiccated from water.[10] An alternative etymology derives the name from the name of th",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T19:42:09.600451,"[""occupied kashmir""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,low,english,pakistan,website,0.0

Until the mid-19th century, the term Kashmir geographically denoted only the valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Then the name was used for the larger area of a princely state centered on the valley. Today, that area is divided between India, Pakistan, and China. Kashmir's total land area is 225,000 km2 (87,000 mi2), larger than 87 member countries of the United Nations and all but ten states in the US; it is only slightly smaller than the UK (243,000 km2). In the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism. Nature has lavishly endowed Kashmir with certain distinctive features that are paralleled by few alpine regions in the world. It is a land of snow clad mountains known for its extravagant natural beauty and contained major caravan routes in ancient times.

'land of the Khalsa') in the Punjab region.[2] The proposed boundaries of Khalistan vary between different groups; some suggest the entirety of the Sikh-majority Indian state of Punjab, while larger claims include Pakistani Punjab and other parts of North India such as Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.[3] The call for a separate Sikh state began during the 1930s, when British rule in India was nearing its end.[4] In 1940, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in a pamphlet titled ""Khalistan"".[5][6] In the 1940s, a demand for a Sikh country called 'Sikhistan' arose.[7] With financial and political support from the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab ‚Äì which has a Sikh-majority population ‚Äì continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, and reaching its zenith in the late 1980s. The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter affirmed his support for the Khalistan movement in retaliation for the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, which resulted in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan.[8] The insurgency in Punjab started in the early 1980s after 1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clash.[9][10] Several Pro-Khalistan groups were involved in the armed insurgency, including Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Commando Force, among others.[11] In 1986, Khalistan Commando Force took responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Vaidya, in retaliation for 1984's Operation Blue Star.[12][13] By the mid-1990s, the insurgency petered out, with the last major incident being the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh, who was killed in a bomb blast by a member of ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T19:43:01.244964,"[""Hindu nationalism"", ""kashmir liberation"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.008596234849136079

2025-08-28T19:43:18.726458,The Khalistan Movement in Canada: A Political Consensus - MP-IDSA,"Introduction On 22 July 2024, the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton was vandalised by the Khalistan separatists with hateful and anti-India graffiti.1 This incident occurred on the heels of another incident on 19 June 2024 wherein the Canadian parliament observed a minute‚Äôs silence on the first death anniversary of designated Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. A moment of silence in the parliament reflects an unequivocal consensus among representatives of all the political parties in the House of Commons.2 Such non-partisan consensus vis-√†-vis Khalistani separatists has not been uncommon in Canada. Since the early 1980s, the Canadian political landscape, irrespective of the political parties in power, has been permissive, if not sympathetic, to the Khalistan movement. The driving forces behind such political consensus have ranged from Cold War dynamics before 1990s to domestic politics at present. For years, successive Canadian governments, regardless of the political parties in power, have demonstrated a tendency to overlook Indian security concerns and have adopted a lenient approach towards Khalistan-related activities. While doing so, the Canadian government‚Äôs attitude has been shaped by three overarching factors‚ÄîCold War dynamics; political stance on freedom of expression; and considerations of vote bank politics. Cold War Era Dynamics During the Cold War, in alignment with other Western countries, Canada engaged with India through various bilateral avenues such as project financing, food aid and technical assistance. This was exemplified by the establishment of the CIRUS nuclear reactor at the Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment in 1954. However, bilateral relations between the two nations experienced a downturn following India‚Äôs peaceful nuclear explosion in 1974 with fissile materials sourced from the aforementioned reactor.

Since the 1980s, radical separatists have spearheaded a bloody campaign to carve out an independent, theocratic Sikh state in India known as Khalistan (Land of the Pure). Despite being dormant in India, the Khalistan movement has recently surged vigorously in the Western diaspora. Khalistani extremists have actively used American, Canadian, and British soil for their cause and grown increasingly violent. In the past year alone, Khalistanis attacked both the Consulate General of India in San Francisco and India High Commission in London and vandalized temples in New York City, in the Toronto area Australia, and California. The FBI, DEA, and United States Customs Service (USCS) have conducted numerous investigations into the activities of pro-Khalistan extremists in the US. Download our Khalistan brief for law enforcement here LISTEN: THAT'S SO HINDU History of the Khalistani Movement‚Äôs Aims and Methods The roots of Khalistan lie in the British colonial policies of the late 1800s and early 1900s that sought to divide Sikhs and Hindus. Sikhs were recruited into the British army in large numbers to use against Hindu rulers that rebelled against the British Raj. Subsequently, after Indian independence in 1947, tensions between the state of Punjab and the central Indian government surfaced, leading to grievances amongst many Sikhs against the Indian government. Punjab, for instance, was trifurcated into the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh in 1966, along linguistic lines (Punjab as a Punjabi speaking state, and Haryana and Himachal Pradesh as Hindi speaking states), which created resentment amongst many Sikhs that the historic contours of Punjab were being further divided after it has already been divided between India and Pakistan in 1947. Many Sikhs in Punjab also resented sharing the joint capital of Chandigarh with Haryana, and viewed water sharing agreements with Haryana ",https://www.hinduamerican.org/khalistan/,www.hinduamerican.org,2025-08-28T19:43:23.391838,"[""anti-India"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.hinduamerican.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.05234231876472127

The primary source of funding of KCF is looting, bank robbery and extortion. It is also involved in large scale smuggling of weapons from Pakistan to India across the International border.[7] History[edit] Khalistan Commando Force was founded by the Sarbat Khalsa and Panthic Committee. It was the official army of Khalistan.[8] Manbir Singh Chaheru was made the leader in February 1986.[9][10][11] On 8 August 1986, Punjab Police arrested Manbir Singh Chaheru (""Hari Singh""), and he was eventually killed[12][13] or disappeared[14] while in police custody. After Chaheru was arrested, former police officer Sukhdev Singh, also known as Sukha Sipahi, took command of the KCF.

Chris Helgren/Reuters CNN ‚Äî In the early hours of June 23, 1985, a bomb planted in the cargo hold of Air India flight 182 traveling from Montreal to New Delhi exploded off the coast of Ireland, killing all 329 people on board. The people arrested and charged for the bomb attack were Indian-born Sikh Canadians, alleged by prosecutors to be radical separatists seeking revenge for the Indian army‚Äôs deadly storming of the Golden Temple in Punjab state the previous year. Only one was convicted; two were acquitted in 2005, and in 2016, Canada released the only person ever found guilty of the bombing. Nearly four decades on, that terrorist attack ‚Äì which remains the worst in Canada‚Äôs history ‚Äì and the wider history of overseas Sikh separatism has suddenly been thrust back into the international spotlight in the wake of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‚Äôs allegations the Indian state may have been involved in the June killing on Canadian soil of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. New Delhi had previously designated Nijjar, an Indian-born Canadian national, as a terrorist, and accused him of being behind a banned militant group that sought to ‚Äúradicalize the Sikh community across the world‚Äù in support of Khalistan ‚Äì a separate Sikh homeland that would include parts of India. Nijjar‚Äôs supporters rejected the terrorist label, arguing it was used to discredit the Sikh leader, who was known for his Khalistan advocacy and speaking out against alleged human rights abuses by India‚Äôs government. Trudeau‚Äôs assassination claim has inflamed relations with New Delhi, which has fiercely denied the allegation and taken a series of diplomatic measures to make clear its displeasure with Canada.

2025-08-28T19:48:55.468753,Khalistan movement - Wikipedia,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Sikh separatist movement in the Punjab region The proposed flag of Khalistan is often used as a symbol of the Khalistan movement.[1] The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement seeking to create a homeland for Sikhs by establishing an ethno-religious sovereign state called Khalistan[A] (lit. 'land of the Khalsa') in the Punjab region.[2] The proposed boundaries of Khalistan vary between different groups; some suggest the entirety of the Sikh-majority Indian state of Punjab, while larger claims include Pakistani Punjab and other parts of North India such as Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.[3] The call for a separate Sikh state began during the 1930s, when British rule in India was nearing its end.[4] In 1940, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in a pamphlet titled ""Khalistan"".[5][6] In the 1940s, a demand for a Sikh country called 'Sikhistan' arose.[7] With financial and political support from the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab ‚Äì which has a Sikh-majority population ‚Äì continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, and reaching its zenith in the late 1980s. The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter affirmed his support for the Khalistan movement in retaliation for the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, which resulted in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan.[8] The insurgency in Punjab started in the early 1980s after 1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clash.[9][10] Several Pro-Khalistan groups were involved in the armed insurgency, including Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Commando Force, among others.[11] In 1986, Khalistan Commando Force took responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Vaidya, in retaliation for 1984's Operation Blue Star.[12][13] By the mid-1990s, the insurgency petered out, with the last major incident being the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh, who was killed in a bomb blast by a member of ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T19:48:55.421506,"[""Hindu nationalism"", ""kashmir liberation"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.008596234849136079

2025-08-28T19:49:05.937376,The Khalistan Movement in Canada: A Political Consensus - MP-IDSA,"Introduction On 22 July 2024, the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton was vandalised by the Khalistan separatists with hateful and anti-India graffiti.1 This incident occurred on the heels of another incident on 19 June 2024 wherein the Canadian parliament observed a minute‚Äôs silence on the first death anniversary of designated Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. A moment of silence in the parliament reflects an unequivocal consensus among representatives of all the political parties in the House of Commons.2 Such non-partisan consensus vis-√†-vis Khalistani separatists has not been uncommon in Canada. Since the early 1980s, the Canadian political landscape, irrespective of the political parties in power, has been permissive, if not sympathetic, to the Khalistan movement. The driving forces behind such political consensus have ranged from Cold War dynamics before 1990s to domestic politics at present. For years, successive Canadian governments, regardless of the political parties in power, have demonstrated a tendency to overlook Indian security concerns and have adopted a lenient approach towards Khalistan-related activities. While doing so, the Canadian government‚Äôs attitude has been shaped by three overarching factors‚ÄîCold War dynamics; political stance on freedom of expression; and considerations of vote bank politics. Cold War Era Dynamics During the Cold War, in alignment with other Western countries, Canada engaged with India through various bilateral avenues such as project financing, food aid and technical assistance. This was exemplified by the establishment of the CIRUS nuclear reactor at the Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment in 1954. However, bilateral relations between the two nations experienced a downturn following India‚Äôs peaceful nuclear explosion in 1974 with fissile materials sourced from the aforementioned reactor.

Since the 1980s, radical separatists have spearheaded a bloody campaign to carve out an independent, theocratic Sikh state in India known as Khalistan (Land of the Pure). Despite being dormant in India, the Khalistan movement has recently surged vigorously in the Western diaspora. Khalistani extremists have actively used American, Canadian, and British soil for their cause and grown increasingly violent. In the past year alone, Khalistanis attacked both the Consulate General of India in San Francisco and India High Commission in London and vandalized temples in New York City, in the Toronto area Australia, and California. The FBI, DEA, and United States Customs Service (USCS) have conducted numerous investigations into the activities of pro-Khalistan extremists in the US. Download our Khalistan brief for law enforcement here LISTEN: THAT'S SO HINDU History of the Khalistani Movement‚Äôs Aims and Methods The roots of Khalistan lie in the British colonial policies of the late 1800s and early 1900s that sought to divide Sikhs and Hindus. Sikhs were recruited into the British army in large numbers to use against Hindu rulers that rebelled against the British Raj. Subsequently, after Indian independence in 1947, tensions between the state of Punjab and the central Indian government surfaced, leading to grievances amongst many Sikhs against the Indian government. Punjab, for instance, was trifurcated into the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh in 1966, along linguistic lines (Punjab as a Punjabi speaking state, and Haryana and Himachal Pradesh as Hindi speaking states), which created resentment amongst many Sikhs that the historic contours of Punjab were being further divided after it has already been divided between India and Pakistan in 1947. Many Sikhs in Punjab also resented sharing the joint capital of Chandigarh with Haryana, and viewed water sharing agreements with Haryana ",https://www.hinduamerican.org/khalistan/,www.hinduamerican.org,2025-08-28T19:49:13.226608,"[""anti-India"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.hinduamerican.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.05234231876472127

India has denied the allegations from Canada, describing them as ""absurd"". After the US allegations emerged, India said it had formed a high-level inquiry committee to address them. For anyone new to this long-running controversy, here's an at-a-glance look at the history and current context:Who are Sikhs and where do they live?Sikhism is one of the world's major religions, founded in the 16th Century in the Punjab region of what is now India and Pakistan - which was divided between the two countries after the end of British rule in 1947.There are around 25 million Sikhs worldwide, making it the fifth largest faith group. The vast majority live in India, where they make up around 2% of the country's 1.4bn people. But significant diaspora populations exist as well.Canada is home to the largest population outside India, with around 780,000 Sikh people - more than 2% of the country's population - while both the US and UK are home to around 500,000 and Australia around 200,000.

(AP Photo) by Yousaf Junaid Aug 05, 2025 12:05 am The U.N.-administered plebiscite in Kashmir is vital for sustainable peace in South Asia As the calendar marks Aug. 5, we solemnly observe ""Youm-e Istehsal-e-Kashmir"" (the Day of Exploitation of Kashmir), the day when the Indian government, breaching fundamental international legal norms and rules, illegally and unilaterally revoked articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution. These articles conferred autonomous status upon Kashmir, along with special rights and privileges for the Kashmiris. Though these Indian constitutional guarantees are in no way a substitute for the United Nations-sponsored plebiscite, their revocation was a step toward the Indian colonization drive of Jammu and Kashmir and steps to alter the ground realities in gross violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions. A ploy that India has learnt from Israel‚Äôs actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. These Indian actions are aimed at further enhancing their ongoing repression and systemic marginalization of the Kashmiri people. The observance of Aug. 5 serves as a stark reminder of the enduring struggle for self-determination and justice, and calls upon the international community to fulfill the promise made to the Kashmiri people by the U.N. Security Council (UNSC), i.e, the right to self-determination. Indian occupation of Kashmir The genesis of the Kashmir issue dates back to the partition of British India in 1947, which was based on the principle that regions with Muslim majorities would be part of Pakistan, while those with Hindu majorities would join India.

Across the country, Muslims have found themselves in the crosshairs of a society baying for blood, and calling for revenge against Pakistan. When India began its airstrikes against Pakistan earlier this week, the vitriol didn‚Äôt stop. It became louder. More obscene. It was as if an entire country united in the call for more blood and more retaliation.

2025-08-28T19:52:10.109380,Kashmir: The Clash of Identities | Beyond Intractability,"By Neha Navlakha March, 2009 Summary Kashmir is a divided state. Two of its regions are controlled by Pakistan and three regions are controlled by India. Both countries, however, lay claim to the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmiri people themselves have long been striving for autonomy and ultimately independence. At its core therefore, this is a conflict that is both intrastate and interstate in its nature. The insurgency began in 1988 initiated by young nationalists from Jammu Kashmir Liberation Force (JKLF) - who crossed over to Pakistan to get trained and armed - supported by Kashmiris who took to the streets to call for a plebiscite after years of being forced to abide by the wishes and rules imposed by the central government. India labeled the insurgency a proxy war by Pakistan and responded with force.[1] In response to the insurgency, India introduced direct rule in 1990. Security forces moved in, the Kashmiri civil administration - education, services, courts, etc. - collapsed, leading to further suffering, discontent and increased despair in the valley. The desperate situation in Kashmir influenced more young Kashmiris to join the militants, as they could see no nonviolent avenue to initiate change. The militant groups thereby grew in size and also turned more Islamist. This was particularly evident after the cease-fire in 1994, as groups such as Lashkar-e-Toiba joined, bringing hardened fighters from Afghanistan, which today form the core of the militants.[2] After three wars - in 1947, 1965 and 1971 - a serious armed conflict in 1999 in Kargil and a UN resolution promising plebiscite, the conflict is still far from over. Despite numerous attempts at finding a solution, parties to the conflict have repeatedly failed at finding an alternative that would satisfy everyone involved.[3] Ultimately, the Kashmir conflict embodies a complex amalgamation of religious, nationalist and political factors which are deeply rooted in history.

The speakers included Dr. Hafsa Kanjwal and the chair ‚Äì Francis Cody. Dr. Kanjwal is an Associate Professor of South Asian History at Lafayette College in Eaton, Pennsylvania. As a modern Kashmir historian, she authored Colonizing Kashmir: State-Building Under Indian Occupation. Esmat Elhalaby is an affiliate of the Centre for South Asian Studies at the Asian Institute and Assistant Professor of Transnational History at the Department of Historical and Cultural Studies. He works principally on the intellectual history of West and South Asia. Before a summary and discussion of the book began, Kanjwal led a brief abstract on her deliberation while writing it. She explored how the text was based on years of research and dialogue with Kashmiri residents on the conditions of Indian occupation between the 1950s and 1980s. Her motivation behind publishing the book was to open dialogue in academia and politics on rethinking colonization by colonized people, understand the intricate sociopolitical dynamics in the Global South, and deliberate on nation-states‚Äô impacts overarchingly. To set the stage for her main arguments, Kanjwal began the discussion with a history lesson on the beginnings of the Indian occupation of Kashmir. She explained how the United Nations ordained a plebiscite to resolve the issue following the partition. However, forces from both Pakistan and India were unrelenting in removing their troops from the occupied territories, and a plebiscite has not occurred since. To strengthen its influence in Kashmir, the Indian government staged a coup to bring Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed to power.

Nehru, speaking of the character of Kashmiris, writes: ‚ÄúIt must be remembered that the people of the Kashmir Valley and round about, though highly gifted in many ways‚Äîin intelligence, in artisanship, etc.‚Äîare not what are called a virile people.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúThey are soft and addicted to easy living. . . .

In Kashmir, however, Indian forces had preemptively arrested thousands, shut down the phones and the internet, and forced Kashmiris to stay inside their homes. Indian bureaucrats, now empowered to rule over the region‚Äôs 13 million people directly, deployed federal agencies to silence Kashmiri activists and intellectuals. No news had arrived from Kashmir.Manzoor‚Äôs wife, Nusrat, picked up the phone. She sounded downcast and fearful.

The recent developments are only a continuation of the historical dispossession and violence intrinsic to its control of Kashmir. The practice of destroying homes has been especially common in the hinterlands. However, it is only in the recent years that news reports have covered this widespread punitive action. In picture, a Kashmiri woman stands on the rubble of her house, destroyed in police action during a gunfight with militants. File photo by ABID BHAT Strange pictures emerged last month in Srinagar, India-administered Kashmir. Police personnel were seen distributing roses amongst doctors and paramedics. This was apparently a damage-control exercise after the department came under fire for harassing people, including the medical staff fighting at the frontlines of the pandemic response, during the Covid-19 lockdown announced by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The images presented a sharp contrast of guns held tightly in one hand and roses in the other, much like India‚Äôs claims of development and empowerment in Kashmir amidst continued violence. Barely days after the guns-and-roses act, unsurprisingly, another doctor was ruthlessly beaten. The images were reminiscent of the roses placed at checkpoints manned by Israeli forces in occupied Palestine. It is a constant reminder of pervasive control, of symbols of violence and love on display at the same time. A Palestinian trying to make sense of the symbolism of walking through mazes of concertina while a rose stares at you had this to say: ‚ÄúThey put you in this misery and humiliating situation and then they confront you with this.

Secondly, it holds the significance of acknowledging and addressing the gross human rights violations in IIOJK. Thirdly, it reaffirms that the Kashmiri struggle for freedom is indeed a struggle against tyranny, surveillance, media blackouts, land dispossession, and at large the ongoing settler colonialism. Lastly, it calls upon the United Nations and the international community to reiterate the need to stop Indian authorities and security forces from undergoing genocide of Kashmiris since 1947.Kashmir, a place of infinite beauty, but a disputed territory, is in a state of constant bloodshed, fear, and destruction. With millions of Kashmiris killed, women raped, children wounded and various properties damaged, the valley has turned into a nightmare for thousands of Kashmiris suffering from extrajudicial killings, illegal imprisonments, detentions, and forced disappearances.

For the last seven decades, Kashmir has been the epicenter of a bitter dispute between India and Pakistan in which the people in Jammu are an integral party. To resolve the conflict, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 47 in 1948, and more than a dozen subsequent resolutions, stipulating that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir would be decided by its people through a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the UN. This was accepted by India and Pakistan and, in accordance with Article 25 of the UN Charter, both parties are obligated to implement these resolutions.

This non-binding referendum, organized by the group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), seeks to gather global Sikh sentiment regarding the establishment of Khalistan, a separate state carved out from the Indian state of Punjab. While the referendum itself does not carry any legal weight, the consequences can be felt across the Sikh diaspora worldwide. This blog discusses the potential consequences of the movement and its impact on a global scale. Table of Contents The Background and Motivations for the Khalistan Referendum 2024 The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement that seeks to create an independent Sikh state called ‚ÄúKhalistan‚Äù in the Punjab region of India. Its origins can be traced back to the historical grievances of Sikhs during and after British colonial rule, with dissatisfaction over political, economic, and social issues that persisted into the post-independence period. Tensions particularly escalated in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by demands for greater autonomy for Punjab and resentment towards the central government. The movement gained significant momentum with the rise of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh militant who gained immense popularity. Bhindrawale and his followers caused huge mayhem in Punjab, with several killings and violent incidents. The conflict between Sikh militants and the Central Government reached its peak in 1984 with Operation Blue Star, a military action ordered by the Indian government to remove Bhindrawale and other militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar, leading to hundreds of casualties. This operation led to a deep sense of anger and resentment among Sikhs, especially due to the temple‚Äôs damage.

According to his lawyers from Scotland, he has been tortured and falsely accused to whom British PM Boris John acknowledged while showing his concern.

Provision of security was denied by BJP government before his murder. In support of Sidhu and separate homeland for Sikhs, more than 17,000 Sikhs voted for Khalistan Referendum in Rome, Italy.

The New York-based lawyer, believed to be in his early 50s, is the legal counsel and spokesman for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a US-based Sikh separatist group that's banned in India since 2019.In the days following the sensational allegation, Delhi said Pannun ""is wanted for violation of the law"" but denied that they had anything to do with the murder plot.

He is wanted in nearly two dozen cases, including some of terrorism and sedition, and in September, his properties in Amritsar and Chandigarh cities were seized. Pannun denies all the charges and says the cases are false. A Sikh - a religious minority which makes up about 2% of India's population - he says he is an activist who just believes in Khalistan.

Both Ottawa and London are most welcome to carve out a Khalistan in any shape, form or fashion if they want to, since they are sovereign countries. As far as India is concerned, there is no traction for such a demand,‚Äù added Mr. Dayal.Meanwhile, radical outfit Dal Khalsa and Simranjeet Singh Mann-led Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) has urged Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) to clear the ‚Äúvagueness and ambiguity‚Äù in its 2020 referendum proposal.SAD (Amritsar) president Simranjeet Singh Mann and Harpal Singh Cheema, president of the Dal Khalsa, in a letter to the SFJ leadership have asked it to spell out, during the event in London on August 12, how they were going to implement the proposal as there were many grey areas in it.READ MORE Published - August 08, 2018 01:48 am IST Read Comments Copy link Email Facebook Twitter Telegram LinkedIn WhatsApp Reddit READ LATER Remove SEE ALL PRINT0 / 0Sign in to unlock member-only benefits!Access 10 free stories every monthSave stories to read laterAccess to comment on every s",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/referendum-bid-to-disturb-punjabs-peace/article24627677.ece,www.thehindu.com,2025-08-28T19:56:59.506981,"[""sikh referendum""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.thehindu.com,0,high,english,canada,website,0.4319654427645789

Confirming the same, an official from Punjab CMO said that the app '2020 Sikh Referendum' is no longer available for smartphone users in India. Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh had urged the Centre to persuade Google in this matter. He had further asked the state DGP to coordinate with central security agencies to tackle the threat resulting from the app created by 'ICETECH'. The mobile application had reportedly asked the general public to register themselves to vote in the 'Punjab Referendum 2020 Khalistan'. Around the same time, a website -- yes2khalistan.org-- was also launched on the same lines for a similar purpose. During analysis of the said application and the website in the DITAC Lab, Punjab, it was found that the data of the registered voters on the app was also linked and stored in the server of the website created and handled by SFJ, an Association banned by the Union Government.Based on these findings, the Cyber Crime Centre of Bureau of Investigation, Punjab, had moved to get the App removed from the Google Play Store and the website blocked for usage in India.Subsequently, on November 8, a notice under Section 79 (3) B of Information Technology Act was sent to the Google legal cell for immediate removal of the mobile app from the Google Play Store.After obtaining the approval from Additional Chief Secretary Home, a request letter was sent to Cyber Law",https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/Nov/19/google-takes-down-sfj-mobile-app-2020-sikh-referendum-from-its-play-store-2063996.html,www.newindianexpress.com,2025-08-28T19:57:01.378130,"[""anti-India"", ""sikh referendum""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.newindianexpress.com,0,low,english,unknown,website,0.21551724137931033

Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the founder and legal adviser of the US-based Khalistani organisation Sikhs for Justice, at a press conference in New York in 2014. In July this year, the home ministry designated Pannun, who enjoys little support in Punjab or outside, as a terrorist. JEWEL SAMAD / AFP / Getty Images Jatinder Kaur Tur 15 October, 2020 Thanks for reading The Caravan. If you find our work valuable, consider subscribing or contributing to The Caravan. Within a year of amending the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, in August 2019, to empower the central government to designate individuals as terrorists, the home ministry has notified 13 terrorists‚Äîfour Muslims and nine Sikhs. On 1 July, the ministry issued a batch of notifications under the new provision, identifying nine new individuals, each associated with different Khalistani organisations, as terrorists. The designation of one among these nine, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, raises questions about the threshold for being branded a terrorist, and whether the home ministry has portrayed a man without local support or presence as a greater threat than he actually poses. Pannun is a founder and the legal adviser of Sikhs for Justice, a United States-based Khalistani secessionist group that was declared an unlawful organisation under the UAPA in July 2019. The organisation and Pannu had both come to prominence in August 2018, when they organised a large rally of pro-Khalistan Sikhs in London‚Äôs Trafalgar Square and announced their campaign, ‚ÄúReferendum 2020.‚Äù The London Declaration‚Äîas the event came to be called‚Äîproclaimed that in November 2020, the SFJ would organise a non-binding referendum of Sikhs from across the world about the secession of Punjab from India, and the constitution of a sovereign Sikh state of Khalistan.

On this historic 77th Independence Day Celebration, I greet you all my fellow compatriots in the precious name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. In this auspicious national occasion let us give thanks to the Lord God, the Creator of the heaven and the earth, who has done marvellous works for the Nagas in their national struggle for freedom.

We Nagas are proud of our past dynamic leaders who took the right decision in declaring the Naga National Independence on the 14th August, 1947 on the eve of the British departure from the British India. It was a historic step that gives new meaning to the Naga National identity and saved the future of the Nagas. In yet another challenging moment, the Naga people reaffirmed their national decision to remain a sovereign independence Nagalim rejecting the offer of Union of India and that of the Burma. I adore and salute those visionary leaders and the revolutionary generations. Immediately after rejection of Union of India by the Nagas, the Indian aggression on Nagalim started resulting in massacre, mass torture, summary execution, mass rape, and mass detention in concentration camps, destruction of villages, Churches, schools and forests. Nevertheless, the Naga people could withstand all those horrible persecutions and oppressions perpetrated against them and survived by the grace of God. History is the living witness. I pay homage to all those martyrs. At every stage of the movement, the Naga people have no dearth of revolutionary patriots who can lead the nation in the right direction against all odds.

Until the mid-19th century, the term Kashmir denoted only the Kashmir Valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal Range. The term has since also come to encompass a larger area that formerly comprised the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, and includes the Indian-administered territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the Pakistani-administered territories of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the Chinese-administered territories of Aksai Chin and the Trans-Karakoram Tract.[1][2][3] The Lidder river valley near Pahalgam Nanga Parbat in Diamer, the ninth-highest mountain on Earth, is the western anchor of the Himalayas In 1819, the Sikh Empire, under Ranjit Singh, annexed the Kashmir valley.[4] In 1846, after the Sikh defeat in the First Anglo-Sikh War, and upon the purchase of the region from the British under the Treaty of Amritsar, the Raja of Jammu, Gulab Singh, became the new ruler of Jammu and Kashmir. The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage)[5][6] of the British Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: China, India, and Pakistan.[1][7][8][2] Etymology The word Kashmir is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as k√°≈õmƒ´ra.[9] A popular local etymology of Kashmir is that it is land desiccated from water.[10] An alternative etymology derives the name from the name of th",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T20:15:35.594104,"[""occupied kashmir""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,low,english,pakistan,website,0.0

It was last updated on 19 December 2023Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kashmir features high mountains and deep valleysThe Himalayan region of Kashmir has been a flashpoint between India and Pakistan for over six decades. Since India's partition and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two wars over the Muslim-majority territory, which both claim in full but control in part.Today it remains one of the most militarised zones in the world. China administers parts of the territory. The population of historic Kashmir is divided into about 10 million people in Indian-administrated Jammu and Kashmir and 4.5 million in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. There are a further 1.8 million people in the Gilgit-Baltistan autonomous territory, which Pakistan created from northern Kashmir and the two small princely states of Hunza and Nagar in 1970.See more country profiles, external - Profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring, externalHISTORY SINCE 1947When India and Pakistan gained independence from British rule in 1947, the various princely rulers were able to choose which state to join. The Maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh, was the Hindu head of a majority Muslim state sandwiched between the two countries and could not decide. He signed an interim ""standstill"" agreement to maintain transport and other services with Pakistan.In October 1947 tribesmen from Pakistan invaded Kashmir, spurred by reports of attacks on Muslims and frustrated by Hari Singh's delaying tactics. The Maharaja asked for Indian military assistance.India's governor-general, Lord Mountbatten, believed peace would best be served by Kashmir's joining India on a temporary basis, pending a vote on its ultimate status. Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession that month, ceding control over foreign and defence policy to India. Indian troops took two-thirds of the territory, and Pakistan seized the northern remainder.

Kashmir's total land area is 225,000 km2 (87,000 mi2), larger than 87 member countries of the United Nations and all but ten states in the US; it is only slightly smaller than the UK (243,000 km2). In the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism. Nature has lavishly endowed Kashmir with certain distinctive features that are paralleled by few alpine regions in the world. It is a land of snow clad mountains known for its extravagant natural beauty and contained major caravan routes in ancient times. Regions[edit] While Kashmir is disputed, each region is described as part of the country which has de facto control. This should not be seen as a political endorsement of any claim.

'land of the Khalsa') in the Punjab region.[2] The proposed boundaries of Khalistan vary between different groups; some suggest the entirety of the Sikh-majority Indian state of Punjab, while larger claims include Pakistani Punjab and other parts of North India such as Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.[3] The call for a separate Sikh state began during the 1930s, when British rule in India was nearing its end.[4] In 1940, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in a pamphlet titled ""Khalistan"".[5][6] In the 1940s, a demand for a Sikh country called 'Sikhistan' arose.[7] With financial and political support from the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab ‚Äì which has a Sikh-majority population ‚Äì continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, and reaching its zenith in the late 1980s. The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter affirmed his support for the Khalistan movement in retaliation for the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, which resulted in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan.[8] The insurgency in Punjab started in the early 1980s after 1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clash.[9][10] Several Pro-Khalistan groups were involved in the armed insurgency, including Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Commando Force, among others.[11] In 1986, Khalistan Commando Force took responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Vaidya, in retaliation for 1984's Operation Blue Star.[12][13] By the mid-1990s, the insurgency petered out, with the last major incident being the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh, who was killed in a bomb blast by a member of ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T20:16:23.344527,"[""Hindu nationalism"", ""kashmir liberation"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.008596234849136079

The rule of his descendants, under the paramountcy (or tutelage)[5][6] of the British Crown, lasted until the Partition of India in 1947, when the former princely state of the British Indian Empire became a disputed territory, now administered by three countries: China, India, and Pakistan.[1][7][8][2] Etymology The word Kashmir is thought to have been derived from Sanskrit and was referred to as k√°≈õmƒ´ra.[9] A popular local etymology of Kashmir is that it is land desiccated from water.[10] An alternative etymology derives the name from the name of th",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T20:16:30.470981,"[""occupied kashmir""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,low,english,pakistan,website,0.0

2025-08-28T20:16:53.076513,The Khalistan Movement in Canada: A Political Consensus - MP-IDSA,"Introduction On 22 July 2024, the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton was vandalised by the Khalistan separatists with hateful and anti-India graffiti.1 This incident occurred on the heels of another incident on 19 June 2024 wherein the Canadian parliament observed a minute‚Äôs silence on the first death anniversary of designated Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. A moment of silence in the parliament reflects an unequivocal consensus among representatives of all the political parties in the House of Commons.2 Such non-partisan consensus vis-√†-vis Khalistani separatists has not been uncommon in Canada. Since the early 1980s, the Canadian political landscape, irrespective of the political parties in power, has been permissive, if not sympathetic, to the Khalistan movement. The driving forces behind such political consensus have ranged from Cold War dynamics before 1990s to domestic politics at present. For years, successive Canadian governments, regardless of the political parties in power, have demonstrated a tendency to overlook Indian security concerns and have adopted a lenient approach towards Khalistan-related activities. While doing so, the Canadian government‚Äôs attitude has been shaped by three overarching factors‚ÄîCold War dynamics; political stance on freedom of expression; and considerations of vote bank politics. Cold War Era Dynamics During the Cold War, in alignment with other Western countries, Canada engaged with India through various bilateral avenues such as project financing, food aid and technical assistance. This was exemplified by the establishment of the CIRUS nuclear reactor at the Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment in 1954. However, bilateral relations between the two nations experienced a downturn following India‚Äôs peaceful nuclear explosion in 1974 with fissile materials sourced from the aforementioned reactor.

Since the 1980s, radical separatists have spearheaded a bloody campaign to carve out an independent, theocratic Sikh state in India known as Khalistan (Land of the Pure). Despite being dormant in India, the Khalistan movement has recently surged vigorously in the Western diaspora. Khalistani extremists have actively used American, Canadian, and British soil for their cause and grown increasingly violent. In the past year alone, Khalistanis attacked both the Consulate General of India in San Francisco and India High Commission in London and vandalized temples in New York City, in the Toronto area Australia, and California. The FBI, DEA, and United States Customs Service (USCS) have conducted numerous investigations into the activities of pro-Khalistan extremists in the US. Download our Khalistan brief for law enforcement here LISTEN: THAT'S SO HINDU History of the Khalistani Movement‚Äôs Aims and Methods The roots of Khalistan lie in the British colonial policies of the late 1800s and early 1900s that sought to divide Sikhs and Hindus. Sikhs were recruited into the British army in large numbers to use against Hindu rulers that rebelled against the British Raj. Subsequently, after Indian independence in 1947, tensions between the state of Punjab and the central Indian government surfaced, leading to grievances amongst many Sikhs against the Indian government. Punjab, for instance, was trifurcated into the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh in 1966, along linguistic lines (Punjab as a Punjabi speaking state, and Haryana and Himachal Pradesh as Hindi speaking states), which created resentment amongst many Sikhs that the historic contours of Punjab were being further divided after it has already been divided between India and Pakistan in 1947. Many Sikhs in Punjab also resented sharing the joint capital of Chandigarh with Haryana, and viewed water sharing agreements with Haryana ",https://www.hinduamerican.org/khalistan/,www.hinduamerican.org,2025-08-28T20:16:56.880468,"[""anti-India"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.hinduamerican.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.05234231876472127

Until the mid-19th century, the term Kashmir geographically denoted only the valley between the Great Himalayas and the Pir Panjal mountain range. Then the name was used for the larger area of a princely state centered on the valley. Today, that area is divided between India, Pakistan, and China. Kashmir's total land area is 225,000 km2 (87,000 mi2), larger than 87 member countries of the United Nations and all but ten states in the US; it is only slightly smaller than the UK (243,000 km2). In the first half of the first millennium, the Kashmir region became an important centre of Hinduism and later of Buddhism. Nature has lavishly endowed Kashmir with certain distinctive features that are paralleled by few alpine regions in the world. It is a land of snow clad mountains known for its extravagant natural beauty and contained major caravan routes in ancient times. Regions[edit] While Kashmir is disputed, each region is described as part of the country which has de facto control. This should not be seen as a political endorsement of any claim.

2025-08-28T20:17:35.510857,Khalistan movement - Wikipedia,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Sikh separatist movement in the Punjab region The proposed flag of Khalistan is often used as a symbol of the Khalistan movement.[1] The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement seeking to create a homeland for Sikhs by establishing an ethno-religious sovereign state called Khalistan[A] (lit. 'land of the Khalsa') in the Punjab region.[2] The proposed boundaries of Khalistan vary between different groups; some suggest the entirety of the Sikh-majority Indian state of Punjab, while larger claims include Pakistani Punjab and other parts of North India such as Chandigarh, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh.[3] The call for a separate Sikh state began during the 1930s, when British rule in India was nearing its end.[4] In 1940, the first explicit call for Khalistan was made in a pamphlet titled ""Khalistan"".[5][6] In the 1940s, a demand for a Sikh country called 'Sikhistan' arose.[7] With financial and political support from the Sikh diaspora, the movement flourished in the Indian state of Punjab ‚Äì which has a Sikh-majority population ‚Äì continuing through the 1970s and 1980s, and reaching its zenith in the late 1980s. The Sikh separatist leader Jagjit Singh Chohan said that during his talks with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the latter affirmed his support for the Khalistan movement in retaliation for the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, which resulted in the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan.[8] The insurgency in Punjab started in the early 1980s after 1978 Sikh‚ÄìNirankari clash.[9][10] Several Pro-Khalistan groups were involved in the armed insurgency, including Babbar Khalsa and Khalistan Commando Force, among others.[11] In 1986, Khalistan Commando Force took responsibility for the assassination of General Arun Vaidya, in retaliation for 1984's Operation Blue Star.[12][13] By the mid-1990s, the insurgency petered out, with the last major incident being the assassination of Chief Minister Beant Singh, who was killed in a bomb blast by a member of ",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalistan_movement,en.wikipedia.org,2025-08-28T20:17:35.456483,"[""Hindu nationalism"", ""kashmir liberation"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,en.wikipedia.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.008596234849136079

2025-08-28T20:17:54.409244,The Khalistan Movement in Canada: A Political Consensus - MP-IDSA,"Introduction On 22 July 2024, the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Edmonton was vandalised by the Khalistan separatists with hateful and anti-India graffiti.1 This incident occurred on the heels of another incident on 19 June 2024 wherein the Canadian parliament observed a minute‚Äôs silence on the first death anniversary of designated Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. A moment of silence in the parliament reflects an unequivocal consensus among representatives of all the political parties in the House of Commons.2 Such non-partisan consensus vis-√†-vis Khalistani separatists has not been uncommon in Canada. Since the early 1980s, the Canadian political landscape, irrespective of the political parties in power, has been permissive, if not sympathetic, to the Khalistan movement. The driving forces behind such political consensus have ranged from Cold War dynamics before 1990s to domestic politics at present. For years, successive Canadian governments, regardless of the political parties in power, have demonstrated a tendency to overlook Indian security concerns and have adopted a lenient approach towards Khalistan-related activities. While doing so, the Canadian government‚Äôs attitude has been shaped by three overarching factors‚ÄîCold War dynamics; political stance on freedom of expression; and considerations of vote bank politics. Cold War Era Dynamics During the Cold War, in alignment with other Western countries, Canada engaged with India through various bilateral avenues such as project financing, food aid and technical assistance. This was exemplified by the establishment of the CIRUS nuclear reactor at the Trombay Atomic Energy Establishment in 1954. However, bilateral relations between the two nations experienced a downturn following India‚Äôs peaceful nuclear explosion in 1974 with fissile materials sourced from the aforementioned reactor.

Since the 1980s, radical separatists have spearheaded a bloody campaign to carve out an independent, theocratic Sikh state in India known as Khalistan (Land of the Pure). Despite being dormant in India, the Khalistan movement has recently surged vigorously in the Western diaspora. Khalistani extremists have actively used American, Canadian, and British soil for their cause and grown increasingly violent. In the past year alone, Khalistanis attacked both the Consulate General of India in San Francisco and India High Commission in London and vandalized temples in New York City, in the Toronto area Australia, and California. The FBI, DEA, and United States Customs Service (USCS) have conducted numerous investigations into the activities of pro-Khalistan extremists in the US. Download our Khalistan brief for law enforcement here LISTEN: THAT'S SO HINDU History of the Khalistani Movement‚Äôs Aims and Methods The roots of Khalistan lie in the British colonial policies of the late 1800s and early 1900s that sought to divide Sikhs and Hindus. Sikhs were recruited into the British army in large numbers to use against Hindu rulers that rebelled against the British Raj. Subsequently, after Indian independence in 1947, tensions between the state of Punjab and the central Indian government surfaced, leading to grievances amongst many Sikhs against the Indian government. Punjab, for instance, was trifurcated into the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh in 1966, along linguistic lines (Punjab as a Punjabi speaking state, and Haryana and Himachal Pradesh as Hindi speaking states), which created resentment amongst many Sikhs that the historic contours of Punjab were being further divided after it has already been divided between India and Pakistan in 1947. Many Sikhs in Punjab also resented sharing the joint capital of Chandigarh with Haryana, and viewed water sharing agreements with Haryana ",https://www.hinduamerican.org/khalistan/,www.hinduamerican.org,2025-08-28T20:17:56.531927,"[""anti-India"", ""khalistan movement""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.hinduamerican.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.05234231876472127

India has denied the allegations from Canada, describing them as ""absurd"". After the US allegations emerged, India said it had formed a high-level inquiry committee to address them.

(AP Photo) by Yousaf Junaid Aug 05, 2025 12:05 am The U.N.-administered plebiscite in Kashmir is vital for sustainable peace in South Asia As the calendar marks Aug. 5, we solemnly observe ""Youm-e Istehsal-e-Kashmir"" (the Day of Exploitation of Kashmir), the day when the Indian government, breaching fundamental international legal norms and rules, illegally and unilaterally revoked articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution. These articles conferred autonomous status upon Kashmir, along with special rights and privileges for the Kashmiris. Though these Indian constitutional guarantees are in no way a substitute for the United Nations-sponsored plebiscite, their revocation was a step toward the Indian colonization drive of Jammu and Kashmir and steps to alter the ground realities in gross violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions. A ploy that India has learnt from Israel‚Äôs actions in the occupied Palestinian territories. These Indian actions are aimed at further enhancing their ongoing repression and systemic marginalization of the Kashmiri people. The observance of Aug. 5 serves as a stark reminder of the enduring struggle for self-determination and justice, and calls upon the international community to fulfill the promise made to the Kashmiri people by the U.N. Security Council (UNSC), i.e, the right to self-determination. Indian occupation of Kashmir The genesis of the Kashmir issue dates back to the partition of British India in 1947, which was based on the principle that regions with Muslim majorities would be part of Pakistan, while those with Hindu majorities would join India.

2025-08-28T20:19:54.035797,Kashmir: The Clash of Identities | Beyond Intractability,"By Neha Navlakha March, 2009 Summary Kashmir is a divided state. Two of its regions are controlled by Pakistan and three regions are controlled by India. Both countries, however, lay claim to the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmiri people themselves have long been striving for autonomy and ultimately independence. At its core therefore, this is a conflict that is both intrastate and interstate in its nature. The insurgency began in 1988 initiated by young nationalists from Jammu Kashmir Liberation Force (JKLF) - who crossed over to Pakistan to get trained and armed - supported by Kashmiris who took to the streets to call for a plebiscite after years of being forced to abide by the wishes and rules imposed by the central government. India labeled the insurgency a proxy war by Pakistan and responded with force.[1] In response to the insurgency, India introduced direct rule in 1990. Security forces moved in, the Kashmiri civil administration - education, services, courts, etc. - collapsed, leading to further suffering, discontent and increased despair in the valley. The desperate situation in Kashmir influenced more young Kashmiris to join the militants, as they could see no nonviolent avenue to initiate change. The militant groups thereby grew in size and also turned more Islamist. This was particularly evident after the cease-fire in 1994, as groups such as Lashkar-e-Toiba joined, bringing hardened fighters from Afghanistan, which today form the core of the militants.[2] After three wars - in 1947, 1965 and 1971 - a serious armed conflict in 1999 in Kargil and a UN resolution promising plebiscite, the conflict is still far from over. Despite numerous attempts at finding a solution, parties to the conflict have repeatedly failed at finding an alternative that would satisfy everyone involved.[3] Ultimately, the Kashmir conflict embodies a complex amalgamation of religious, nationalist and political factors which are deeply rooted in history.

Or can Islam constitute the lifeblood of the struggle that Muslims lead against the condition of colonization?

The speakers included Dr. Hafsa Kanjwal and the chair ‚Äì Francis Cody. Dr. Kanjwal is an Associate Professor of South Asian History at Lafayette College in Eaton, Pennsylvania. As a modern Kashmir historian, she authored Colonizing Kashmir: State-Building Under Indian Occupation. Esmat Elhalaby is an affiliate of the Centre for South Asian Studies at the Asian Institute and Assistant Professor of Transnational History at the Department of Historical and Cultural Studies. He works principally on the intellectual history of West and South Asia. Before a summary and discussion of the book began, Kanjwal led a brief abstract on her deliberation while writing it. She explored how the text was based on years of research and dialogue with Kashmiri residents on the conditions of Indian occupation between the 1950s and 1980s. Her motivation behind publishing the book was to open dialogue in academia and politics on rethinking colonization by colonized people, understand the intricate sociopolitical dynamics in the Global South, and deliberate on nation-states‚Äô impacts overarchingly. To set the stage for her main arguments, Kanjwal began the discussion with a history lesson on the beginnings of the Indian occupation of Kashmir. She explained how the United Nations ordained a plebiscite to resolve the issue following the partition. However, forces from both Pakistan and India were unrelenting in removing their troops from the occupied territories, and a plebiscite has not occurred since. To strengthen its influence in Kashmir, the Indian government staged a coup to bring Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed to power.

Nehru, speaking of the character of Kashmiris, writes: ‚ÄúIt must be remembered that the people of the Kashmir Valley and round about, though highly gifted in many ways‚Äîin intelligence, in artisanship, etc.‚Äîare not what are called a virile people.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúThey are soft and addicted to easy living. . . . The common people are primarily interested in a few things‚Äîan honest administration and cheap and adequate food. If they get this, then they are more or less content.‚Äù2 That Kashmiris had been brought to starvation and famine a number of times in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did not seem to factor into Nehru‚Äôs patronizing understanding of them as being ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúaddicted to easy living.‚Äù The parallels between British colonial attitudes toward Indians as unmanly and lacking virility and Nehru‚Äôs understandings of Kashmiris should not be surprising, the latter‚Äôs ironic reputation as an anti-colonial nationalist (and being of Kashmiri descent himself) notwithstanding.3 These attitudes are fundamental to the process of colonial domination.A year later, the Indian state, with the cooperation of several Kashmiri leaders, turned against Sheikh Abdullah, who, despite pl",https://www.sup.org/books/asian-studies/colonizing-kashmir/excerpt/introduction,www.sup.org,2025-08-28T20:20:40.167699,"[""anti-India"", ""Hindu nationalism"", ""occupied kashmir""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.sup.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.006914194842010648

Is Islam irrelevant for Muslims when they are engaged in a struggle that consumes their lives and permeates their entire existence? Or can Islam constitute the lifeblood of the struggle that Muslims lead against the condition of colonization? The long struggle of Kashmiri Muslims against India‚Äôs occupation tells us that not only is Islam a source of support and hope for a community of Muslims facing fierce oppression, it is also the light that guides the struggle of Kashmiris, the language that defines their quest for justice and the promise that makes surrender unimaginable.A few days back, my 61-year-old mother, who has been in prison for more than 12 years for her involvement with the resistance movement, called my aunt from Tihar Jail, Delhi.

In violation of the Indian Independence Act and the Partition Plan, which gave the people of the former British colonies the right to self-determination, India moved soldiers into the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir on this day. Subsequently, India has employed a range of tactics to strengthen its unlawful and illegitimate rule over Kashmir, including altering the region's demographic makeup, stifling its political ambitions, infringing upon its human rights, and erasing its cultural and historical identity.AmaraDespite UN resolutions, the right to self-determination has not been granted to the Kashmiri people. India has violently suppressed them, denied them fundamental freedoms, and violated their human rights.

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), two Hindu nationalist groups that see Kashmir as a crucial component of their Hindutva ideology, have long harboured this desire.

The speakers included Dr. Hafsa Kanjwal and the chair ‚Äì Francis Cody. Dr. Kanjwal is an Associate Professor of South Asian History at Lafayette College in Eaton, Pennsylvania. As a modern Kashmir historian, she authored Colonizing Kashmir: State-Building Under Indian Occupation. Esmat Elhalaby is an affiliate of the Centre for South Asian Studies at the Asian Institute and Assistant Professor of Transnational History at the Department of Historical and Cultural Studies. He works principally on the intellectual history of West and South Asia. Before a summary and discussion of the book began, Kanjwal led a brief abstract on her deliberation while writing it. She explored how the text was based on years of research and dialogue with Kashmiri residents on the conditions of Indian occupation between the 1950s and 1980s. Her motivation behind publishing the book was to open dialogue in academia and politics on rethinking colonization by colonized people, understand the intricate sociopolitical dynamics in the Global South, and deliberate on nation-states‚Äô impacts overarchingly. To set the stage for her main arguments, Kanjwal began the discussion with a history lesson on the beginnings of the Indian occupation of Kashmir. She explained how the United Nations ordained a plebiscite to resolve the issue following the partition. However, forces from both Pakistan and India were unrelenting in removing their troops from the occupied territories, and a plebiscite has not occurred since. To strengthen its influence in Kashmir, the Indian government staged a coup to bring Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed to power.

Nehru, speaking of the character of Kashmiris, writes: ‚ÄúIt must be remembered that the people of the Kashmir Valley and round about, though highly gifted in many ways‚Äîin intelligence, in artisanship, etc.‚Äîare not what are called a virile people.‚Äù He adds, ‚ÄúThey are soft and addicted to easy living. . . . The common people are primarily interested in a few things‚Äîan honest administration and cheap and adequate food. If they get this, then they are more or less content.‚Äù2 That Kashmiris had been brought to starvation and famine a number of times in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did not seem to factor into Nehru‚Äôs patronizing understanding of them as being ‚Äúsoft‚Äù and ‚Äúaddicted to easy living.‚Äù The parallels between British colonial attitudes toward Indians as unmanly and lacking virility and Nehru‚Äôs understandings of Kashmiris should not be surprising, the latter‚Äôs ironic reputation as an anti-colonial nationalist (and being of Kashmiri descent himself) notwithstanding.3 These attitudes are fundamental to the process of colonial domination.A year later, the Indian state, with the cooperation of several Kashmiri leaders, turned against Sheikh Abdullah, who, despite pl",https://www.sup.org/books/asian-studies/colonizing-kashmir/excerpt/introduction,www.sup.org,2025-08-28T20:21:32.399524,"[""anti-India"", ""Hindu nationalism"", ""occupied kashmir""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,www.sup.org,0,high,english,pakistan,website,-0.006914194842010648

Five months had passed since August 2019 when the Hindu-nationalist government in India abrogated Kashmir‚Äôs semi-autonomous status and opened the region for mainland Indians to settle and own land. In the Indian Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared, ‚ÄúA new era has begun . . . an era of progress and prosperity‚Äù (Ward 2019). In Kashmir, however, Indian forces had preemptively arrested thousands, shut down the phones and the internet, and forced Kashmiris to stay inside their homes.

The recent developments are only a continuation of the historical dispossession and violence intrinsic to its control of Kashmir. The practice of destroying homes has been especially common in the hinterlands. However, it is only in the recent years that news reports have covered this widespread punitive action. In picture, a Kashmiri woman stands on the rubble of her house, destroyed in police action during a gunfight with militants. File photo by ABID BHAT Strange pictures emerged last month in Srinagar, India-administered Kashmir. Police personnel were seen distributing roses amongst doctors and paramedics. This was apparently a damage-control exercise after the department came under fire for harassing people, including the medical staff fighting at the frontlines of the pandemic response, during the Covid-19 lockdown announced by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. The images presented a sharp contrast of guns held tightly in one hand and roses in the other, much like India‚Äôs claims of development and empowerment in Kashmir amidst continued violence. Barely days after the guns-and-roses act, unsurprisingly, another doctor was ruthlessly beaten. The images were reminiscent of the roses placed at checkpoints manned by Israeli forces in occupied Palestine. It is a constant reminder of pervasive control, of symbols of violence and love on display at the same time.

When understood in comparison with other cases of forced demographic changes worldwide, it indicates an accelerated pace towards the erosion of political, cultural, linguistic and social distinctiveness of the native population. The article reflects on how India‚Äôs unilateral abrogation of special status of the region within the Indian polity and post-abrogation settler-colonial strategies are aimed at frustrating the outcome of a prospective self determination exercise covered under UN Security Council resolutions on the Kashmir issue.

For the last seven decades, Kashmir has been the epicenter of a bitter dispute between India and Pakistan in which the people in Jammu are an integral party. To resolve the conflict, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 47 in 1948, and more than a dozen subsequent resolutions, stipulating that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir would be decided by its people through a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the UN. This was accepted by India and Pakistan and, in accordance with Article 25 of the UN Charter, both parties are obligated to implement these resolutions.

The essayist, Pakistan‚Äôs envoy to the United Nations, notes that it has been four years as of Aug. 5 since India took ‚Äúunilateral actions to consolidate its occupation‚Äù of the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir. DAWN VIA PAKISTAN GOVERNMENT As the sun rises over the picturesque landscape of Kashmir, it‚Äôs easy to believe that all is well in the region. But beneath the scenic beauty is a harsh and unsettling reality ‚Äî composed of a military occupation, oppression of the entire population and expression of fear, loathing and anger by the people of Kashmir. The picture that the Indian government tries to paint ‚Äî of normalcy and development in occupied Jammu and Kashmir ‚Äî is a myth. For the last seven decades, Kashmir has been the epicenter of a bitter dispute between India and Pakistan in which the people in Jammu are an integral party. To resolve the conflict, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 47 in 1948, and more than a dozen subsequent resolutions, stipulating that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir would be decided by its people through a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the UN. This was accepted by India and Pakistan and, in accordance with Article 25 of the UN Charter, both parties are obligated to implement these resolutions. But this Saturday, Aug. 5, marks four years of India‚Äôs unilateral actions to consolidate its occupation of Illegally Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and imposing what India‚Äôs leaders have ominously called a ‚Äúfinal solution‚Äù for Kashmir.

The protests continued for over six months and resulted in the killing of around 100 civilians. Some of the most overpowering moments during that period were of women-led protests. February 23rd is Kashmiri Women‚Äôs Resistance Day. In this reflection, writer and activist Essar Batool reflects on Kashmiri women‚Äôs struggle for freedom. I am a woman, living in Indian-occupied Kashmir, a place that has been at the heart of a violent conflict for decades. India has responded to Kashmiris‚Äô longstanding demands for self-determination by deploying 700,000 Indian armed forces personnel to crush the desire for freedom, and as it says, to crush the armed rebellion which currently stands at a rough 150 armed fighters. In this duration of time, India has been responsible for countless war crimes in Kashmir which include extra-judicial custodial killings, enforced disappearances, mass graves, and sexual violence of the worst kind. Women have been at the receiving end of this occupation as direct and indirect victims of violence by the State. Women have lost their loved ones; husbands, brothers and sons, some of whom were killed and some never returned. This gave rise to a new sub-category among women, called ‚Äòhalf-widows‚Äô, women living in the hope of knowing whether their husbands are alive or dead. Moreover, rapes have been used by the Indian armed forces against Kashmiri women, and the figures are alarming; even though these cases have been documented by international investigating agencies such as Human Rights Watch and Physicians for Human Rights, the majority of such cases continue to remain unreported.

It includes disseminating false or misleading information, disinformation, propaganda, and manipulating social media algorithms to amplify or suppress specific messages or opinions. Russia‚Äôs alleged use of social media platforms to spread false information and divisive content to influence the 2016 US Presidential election outcome in Donald Trump‚Äôs favour and the use of malicious bots to undermine the UK Brexit referendum are well-reported. Similarly, China and Pakistan have relentlessly used IW against India, going beyond territorial threats and economic coercion tactics.

This non-binding referendum, organized by the group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), seeks to gather global Sikh sentiment regarding the establishment of Khalistan, a separate state carved out from the Indian state of Punjab. While the referendum itself does not carry any legal weight, the consequences can be felt across the Sikh diaspora worldwide. This blog discusses the potential consequences of the movement and its impact on a global scale. Table of Contents The Background and Motivations for the Khalistan Referendum 2024 The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement that seeks to create an independent Sikh state called ‚ÄúKhalistan‚Äù in the Punjab region of India. Its origins can be traced back to the historical grievances of Sikhs during and after British colonial rule, with dissatisfaction over political, economic, and social issues that persisted into the post-independence period. Tensions particularly escalated in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by demands for greater autonomy for Punjab and resentment towards the central government. The movement gained significant momentum with the rise of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh militant who gained immense popularity. Bhindrawale and his followers caused huge mayhem in Punjab, with several killings and violent incidents. The conflict between Sikh militants and the Central Government reached its peak in 1984 with Operation Blue Star, a military action ordered by the Indian government to remove Bhindrawale and other militants from the Golden Temple in Amritsar, leading to hundreds of casualties. This operation led to a deep sense of anger and resentment among Sikhs, especially due to the temple‚Äôs damage.

The episode of unlawful arrest of the UK-based Sikh activist named Jagtar Singh Johal in 2017 with the help of UK government ignited a huge number of protests across the world. According to his lawyers from Scotland, he has been tortured and falsely accused to whom British PM Boris John acknowledged while showing his concern. Most recently, the murder of Sidhu Moosewala who was an active supporter of Sikh rights is an example of India‚Äôs unjust activities. Provision of security was denied by BJP government before his murder. In support of Sidhu and separate homeland for Sikhs, more than 17,000 Sikhs voted for Khalistan Referendum in Rome, Italy. Similarly, UK having one of the highest ratio of Sikh diaspora, organized a campaign under the active advocates of Sikh rights ‚ÄúSikhs for Justice (SFJ)‚Äù in which 30,000 British Sikhs voted for referendum on 31st October 2021. Series of Sikh referendums are lined up and SFJ declared that after completing this voting series, it will be a decision of 120,000 Sikhs showing the desire for separate land under the rule and law provided them by International Justice System. A huge referendum is planned for the Sikhs of Punjab on 26th January 2023. The roots of these referendum are enrooted into the event of Operation Blue Star happened in 1984.

The New York-based lawyer, believed to be in his early 50s, is the legal counsel and spokesman for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a US-based Sikh separatist group that's banned in India since 2019.In the days following the sensational allegation, Delhi said Pannun ""is wanted for violation of the law"" but denied that they had anything to do with the murder plot. ""A high-level inquiry committee has been formed to investigate the allegation and address the US government's security concerns,"" external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.So who is Pannun and why is he so controversial in India?Delhi has made no bones about its dislike for the Sikh separatist - a man they designated a terrorist in 2020. He is wanted in nearly two dozen cases, including some of terrorism and sedition, and in September, his properties in Amritsar and Chandigarh cities were seized. Pannun denies all the charges and says the cases are false. A Sikh - a religious minority which makes up about 2% of India's population - he says he is an activist who just believes in Khalistan. India crushed a violent armed Sikh insurgency in the 1980s and 1990s and the movement has little support in the country now although some in the Sikh diaspora continue to advocate for Khalistan.

Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the founder and legal adviser of the US-based Khalistani organisation Sikhs for Justice, at a press conference in New York in 2014. In July this year, the home ministry designated Pannun, who enjoys little support in Punjab or outside, as a terrorist. JEWEL SAMAD / AFP / Getty Images Jatinder Kaur Tur 15 October, 2020 Thanks for reading The Caravan. If you find our work valuable, consider subscribing or contributing to The Caravan. Within a year of amending the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, in August 2019, to empower the central government to designate individuals as terrorists, the home ministry has notified 13 terrorists‚Äîfour Muslims and nine Sikhs. On 1 July, the ministry issued a batch of notifications under the new provision, identifying nine new individuals, each associated with different Khalistani organisations, as terrorists. The designation of one among these nine, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, raises questions about the threshold for being branded a terrorist, and whether the home ministry has portrayed a man without local support or presence as a greater threat than he actually poses. Pannun is a founder and the legal adviser of Sikhs for Justice, a United States-based Khalistani secessionist group that was declared an unlawful organisation under the UAPA in July 2019. The organisation and Pannu had both come to prominence in August 2018, when they organised a large rally of pro-Khalistan Sikhs in London‚Äôs Trafalgar Square and announced their campaign, ‚ÄúReferendum 2020.‚Äù The London Declaration‚Äîas the event came to be called‚Äîproclaimed that in November 2020, the SFJ would organise a non-binding referendum of Sikhs from across the world about the secession of Punjab from India, and the constitution of a sovereign Sikh state of Khalistan.

2025-08-28T20:25:26.879511,Khalistan Referendum 2024: What It Means for Sikh Communities Worldwide,"Social Khalistan Referendum 2024: What It Means for Sikh Communities Worldwide The Khalistan Referendum 2024 has become a significant talking point for Sikh diaspora communities, raising questions about identity, autonomy, and aspirations for an independent Sikh-majority nation. This non-binding referendum, organized by the group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), seeks to gather global Sikh sentiment regarding the establishment of Khalistan, a separate state carved out from the Indian state of Punjab. While the referendum itself does not carry any legal weight, the consequences can be felt across the Sikh diaspora worldwide. This blog discusses the potential consequences of the movement and its impact on a global scale. Table of Contents The Background and Motivations for the Khalistan Referendum 2024 The Khalistan movement is a separatist movement that seeks to create an independent Sikh state called ‚ÄúKhalistan‚Äù in the Punjab region of India. Its origins can be traced back to the historical grievances of Sikhs during and after British colonial rule, with dissatisfaction over political, economic, and social issues that persisted into the post-independence period. Tensions particularly escalated in the 1970s and 1980s, driven by demands for greater autonomy for Punjab and resentment towards the central government. The movement gained significant momentum with the rise of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, a Sikh militant who gained immense popularity. Bhindrawale and his followers caused huge mayhem in Punjab, with several killings and violent incidents.

Under these civil liberties, all humans are entitled to revel in those privileges. Sikh community residing around the globe is facing heinous behavior from the India‚Äôs Modi regime as it is a home for many Sikhs. The episode of unlawful arrest of the UK-based Sikh activist named Jagtar Singh Johal in 2017 with the help of UK government ignited a huge number of protests across the world.

The New York-based lawyer, believed to be in his early 50s, is the legal counsel and spokesman for Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), a US-based Sikh separatist group that's banned in India since 2019.In the days following the sensational allegation, Delhi said Pannun ""is wanted for violation of the law"" but denied that they had anything to do with the murder plot.

He is wanted in nearly two dozen cases, including some of terrorism and sedition, and in September, his properties in Amritsar and Chandigarh cities were seized. Pannun denies all the charges and says the cases are false. A Sikh - a religious minority which makes up about 2% of India's population - he says he is an activist who just believes in Khalistan.

Pannun is a founder and the legal adviser of Sikhs for Justice, a United States-based Khalistani secessionist group that was declared an unlawful organisation under the UAPA in July 2019.

Muivah, Ato Kilonser, NSCN/GPRN Public Space 14th August 2023 Th. Muivah Ato Kilonser, NSCN/GPRN My dear countrymen! On this historic 77th Independence Day Celebration, I greet you all my fellow compatriots in the precious name of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. In this auspicious national occasion let us give thanks to the Lord God, the Creator of the heaven and the earth, who has done marvellous works for the Nagas in their national struggle for freedom. In every difficult time the Lord has never abandoned the Nagas. He has been with us in all fronts ‚Äì in the military front, diplomatic front, political front and the spiritual front as well. We Nagas are proud of our past dynamic leaders who took the right decision in declaring the Naga National Independence on the 14th August, 1947 on the eve of the British departure from the British India. It was a historic step that gives new meaning to the Naga National identity and saved the future of the Nagas. In yet another challenging moment, the Naga people reaffirmed their national decision to remain a sovereign independence Nagalim rejecting the offer of Union of India and that of the Burma. I adore and salute those visionary leaders and the revolutionary generations. Immediately after rejection of Union of India by the Nagas, the Indian aggression on Nagalim started resulting in massacre, mass torture, summary execution, mass rape, and mass detention in concentration camps, destruction of villages, Churches, schools and forests. Nevertheless, the Naga people could withstand all those horrible persecutions and oppressions perpetrated against them and survived by the grace of God. History is the living witness. I pay homage to all those martyrs. At every stage of the movement, the Naga people have no dearth of revolutionary patriots who can lead the nation in the right direction against all odds. Upholding the national decision, the Naga National Assembly rejected and condemned both the so-called 16-point memorand",https://morungexpress.com/the-heart-of-the-matter-is-that-nagas-are-a-sovereign-people,morungexpress.com,2025-08-28T20:26:25.661510,"[""Indian aggression""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,morungexpress.com,0,medium,english,uk,website,0.14619883040935672

Mulatonu was the special envoy to the collective leadership of NSCN (K).Sources in the Khehoi camp confirmed Mulatonu's ""desertion"", but said this would not affect the organization based in Nagaland.In another development, the NSCN's military wing, the People's Army of Nagaland, has expressed its loyalty to Khaplang, stating that ""unprecedented leadership crisis and subsequent commotion that has been created need to be clarified so as to dispel any misconception"".In a statement, Niki Sumi, People's Army of Nagaland ""maj-gen"" said, ""With a clear conscience and taking into account the historical bonds that the Nagas share irrespective of some artificially-imposed boundaries, we declare our unequivocal loyalty and reiterate our faith in the leadership of Khaplang.""In the meantime, Khaplang has promoted Sumi, who was the commander of the unit's 3rd brigade, as the ""lieutenant general"" for ""his sincerity, efficiency and loyalty to the cause of the Nagas.""There cannot be two opinions within one group. Our stand on Khaplang is clear.

This marks the first time that Hindutva has been recognised as an ""ideology of concern"" in the UK, following the 2022 Leicester clashes between Hindus and Muslims after an India-Pakistan cricket match.Live TVShareAdvertisementPro-Khalistani extremism is among the nine types of threats to the UK flagged in the British government report. (File Image)India Today World DeskNew Delhi,UPDATED: Jan 29, 2025 12:41 ISTWritten By: Sushim MukulHindu nationalism and Khalistani extremism have been listed among nine emerging threats in the UK, according to a Home Office document that was leaked. The committee was set up by the UK Home Department Secretary of State Yvette Cooper in August 2024. The committee's report, which has been leaked, says that ""Hindu nationalist extremism"" was ""an extremist ideology"", according to a report in The Guardian.

One of the brutal cases ‚Äòthe Una incident‚Äô in Gujarat has triggered nationwide protests and solidarity demonstrations in several countries including the United States. The attack on four young Dalit men, who were skinning cows killed by a lion, involved mob beatings with sticks and rods for several hours. The Dalits were also insulted with caste-based derogatory words, and forced into a vehicle, where beatings continued with an iron. Human rights organisations accuse the police of complicity and involvement in the atrocities, as the police present took no action to stop the violence, and eventually locked up the four Dalit men in police custody.

Islamophobia will impact India‚Äôs international relations somewhat; most, if not all, countries prefer to engage with India on strategic opportunities in military and economic areas instead of looking elsewhere because of their domestic issues. Countries are moving away from the U.S.‚Äôs imposement on sovereignty in the name of human rights and democracy, and Islamophobia in India is a prime example. While there is some anger towards India, it is only in a few instances and does not harm relations significantly. Meanwhile, India continues to grow closer to Israel and work Islamophobia into their fore",https://digitalcollections.sit.edu/isp_collection/3723/,digitalcollections.sit.edu,2025-08-28T20:36:01.035170,"[""Hindu nationalism""]",Google_Dork_Enhanced,digitalcollections.sit.edu,0,low,english,pakistan,website,0.0

On March 30 and 31, communal violence was reported in several states. In Bihar, a mob reportedly vandalized and set fire to a prominent madrassa. The media reported that a Hindu teenager was killed in the clashes. Across the country over 100 people have been arrested and dozens injured. India‚Äôs Hindu festivals are increasingly being used by the ruling Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to rally voters, leading to an increase in violence. These mobs are emboldened by a sense of political patronage that affords them impunity. After violence in opposition-ruled West Bengal state, where authorities arrested over a dozen BJP members and supporters, the party alleged police bias and ‚Äúdisproportionate action.‚Äù The record shows that it is usually Muslims who are unfairly targeted by the authorities. Last April, communal clashes broke out when processions of Hindu men celebrating a religious festival shouted offensive slogans outside mosques. Instead of attempting to stop such incitement or investigate these incidents, BJP authorities in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat responded by summarily demolishing Muslim properties. In October, during another Hindu festival, police in Madhya Pradesh responded to communal clashes by demolishing the homes of three Muslim men accused of throwing stones. Police in Gujarat publicly flogged Muslim men.

2025-08-28T20:36:46.117650,India‚Äôs Hindu Festivals Bring Increasing Anti-Muslim Violence | Human Rights Watch,"Click to expand Image A mob set fire to Madrasa Azizia in Nalanda district of Bihar, India during the Ram Navami festival on March 31, 2023. ¬© 2023 Meer Faisal/Maktoob The Hindu festival of Ram Navami in India, which this year coincided with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, was marred by violence sparked when Hindus in processions passed through Muslim neighborhoods brandishing weapons and shouting anti-Muslim slogans. On March 30 and 31, communal violence was reported in several states. In Bihar, a mob reportedly vandalized and set fire to a prominent madrassa. The media reported that a Hindu teenager was killed in the clashes. Across the country over 100 people have been arrested and dozens injured. India‚Äôs Hindu festivals are increasingly being used by the ruling Hindu majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to rally voters, leading to an increase in violence. These mobs are emboldened by a sense of political patronage that affords them impunity. After violence in opposition-ruled West Bengal state, where authorities arrested over a dozen BJP members and supporters, the party alleged police bias and ‚Äúdisproportionate action.‚Äù The record shows that it is usually Muslims who are unfairly targeted by the authorities. Last April, communal clashes broke out when processions of Hindu men celebrating a religious festival shouted offensive slogans outside mosques. Instead of attempting to stop such incitement or investigate these incidents, BJP authorities in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat responded by summarily demolishing Muslim properties. In October, during another Hindu festival, police in Madhya Pradesh responded to communal clashes by demolishing the homes of three Muslim men accused of throwing stones. Police in Gujarat publicly flogged Muslim men. The BJP governments at every level have adopted discriminatory laws and policies targeting religious minorities, and its leaders and affiliates make frequent anti-minority remarks, including inciting violence.

Violent protests broke out after an attack on June 29, while a church was looted and burned down two days prior. Over the past two months, Manipur‚Äôs largely Hindu Meitei community, which constitute a little over half of the state‚Äôs population, and the Christian-majority Kuki tribal group, which makes up about 16 percent of the population, have violently attacked each other in an outpouring of recrimination and revenge. Over 100 people have been killed and nearly 40,000 displaced. Angry mobs and armed vigilantes have burned down homes, churches, and offices. Manipur has long faced secessionist insurgencies in which both military and state security forces have committed serious human rights abuses. Longstanding ethnic disputes have also erupted into violence. However, instead of adopting measures that would ensure the security of all communities, the Bharatiya Janata Party government of N. Biren Singh in Manipur state has replicated the national party‚Äôs politically motivated divisive policies that promote Hindu majoritarianism. Many Meitei seek the same affirmative action privileges that are provided to the Kuki under their protected tribal status. Tribal groups, particularly the Kuki, have argued that this would expand Meitei economic dominance and allow them to take over land in tribal areas. To address this explosive issue, the government needs to be trusted by all sides to play an impartial role as mediator. Instead, the Singh government has stoked ethnic divides with policy decisions that impact Kuki forest rights, and with unfair allusions to illegal immigrants, drug trade, deforestation, and militancy that fuelled anxiety among the Meitei.

2025-08-28T20:38:50.684253,Manipur Violence Explained: An Analytical Breakdown for UPSC,"Manipur Violence Explained Context: Six people were killed as fresh violence erupted between the warring ethnic communities of Kukis and Meitei in Manipur's Jiribam district on 7th September, forcing the government to call in Army choppers for surveillance and deploy security forces in massive combing operations with drone detection systems in hand. 1. What is the history of Manipur? Royal chronicles, Cheitharol Kumbaba, document the history of Manipuri kings of Ningthouja dynasty to 33 AD, one of the longest-ruling dynasties of India. The kings and people of Manipur followed an indigenous faith known as Sanamahism until the 18th century. At the very beginning of the 18th century, some scholars say in 1704, king Charairongba converted to Hinduism along with his family. Meidingu Pamheiba (named Garib Nawaz by Muslims) was the son of king Charairongba, who is known for his conquest of the Burmese capital. In the year 1891 Manipur became a Princely State under British Rule after the Anglo-Manipur war. In 1947,Maharaja Budhachandra signed a Treaty of Accession merging Manipur into India. Manipur became a Union Territory in 1956 and in the year 1972 it was granted the status of full fledged state. 2. What is the history of ethnic conflicts in Manipur? Manipur is no stranger to violent protests, but the ongoing violence between the Kuki-Zomi tribals and the largely Hindu Meiteis is the first time in three decades that the state has witnessed direct clashes between two ethnic groups. Events Analysis During British era The Kangleipak kingdom, then a British protectorate, was repeatedly raided by Naga tribes who came down from the northern hills. The British political agent in Manipur is believed to have brought the Kuki-Zomi from the Kuki-Chin hills of Burma to protect the valley from plunder by acting as a buffer between the Meiteis and the Nagas.

Drawing on her vast experience as a human rights activist, journalist, and peace educator, Setalvad‚Äôs responses map the continuum ‚Äî across years, anti-minority pogroms and ruling parties with divergent ideologies ‚Äî of the cultures of hate, and the practices of state repression and impunity in a proto-fascist India. Setalvad offers an interrogation of the ideology of the Hindu right, delves into the historical trajectories of the rise of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). She also charts the repeating patterns of police and media complicity in fomenting anti-minority hate and critically analyses the contradictory role of the criminal law and the Constitution of India in both enabling and resisting communal violence. In conclusion, she offers hopeful strategies for keeping alive the promise of secularism.

The online discussion, conducted by IIMB, took place at 6 pm on October 23, and had speakers who talked about lived experiences as well as what they had found in their fields of work on caste.The crux of the nearly two-hour-long discussion was that caste is visible and tangible in the way Indian cities, and the society, work. Professor Deepak shared that 95% of faculty members at IITs and IIMs are drawn from only 5% of society, meaning that only 5% of India‚Äôs diverse social groups are represented in the faculty of these renowned institutions.Cynthia Stephen, a Dalit activist, writer, social policy researcher and journalist, shared her experience of caste.
